Beck, PhD, is President of the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy (www.beckinstitute.org) and Clinical Associate Profes- sor of Psychology in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. She has written nearly 100 articles and chapters as well as several books for professionals and consumers; has made hundreds of presentations, nationally and internationally, on topics related to cogni- tive behavior therapy; and is the codeveloper of the Beck Youth Inven- tories and the Personality Belief Questionnaire. Dr. Beck is a founding fellow and past president of the Academy of Cognitive Therapy.  ix Foreword I am delighted that the success of the first edition of Cognitive Ther- apy: Basics and Beyond has prompted this revision. It offers readers fresh insights into this approach to psychotherapy, and, I trust, will be welcomed by those who are versed in cognitive behavior therapy as well as students new to the field. Given the tremendous amount of new research and expansion of ideas that continue to move the field in exciting new directions, I applaud the efforts to expand this volume to incorporate some of the different ways of conceptualizing and treating our patients. I would like to take the reader back to the early days of cognitive therapy and its development since then. When I first started treating patients with a set of therapeutic procedures that I subsequently labeled \u201ccognitive therapy\u201d (and now refer to as \u201ccognitive behavior therapy\u201d), I had no idea where this approach\u2014which departed so strongly from my psychoanalytic training\u2014would lead me. Based on my clinical obser- vations and some systematic clinical studies and experiments, I theo- rized that there was a thinking disorder at the core of the psychiatric syndromes such as depression and anxiety. This disorder was reflected in a systematic bias in the way the patients interpreted particular expe- riences. By pointing out these biased interpretations and proposing alternatives\u2014that is, more probable explanations\u2014I found that I could produce an almost immediate lessening of the symptoms. Training the patients in these cognitive skills helped to sustain the improvement. This concentration on here-and-now problems appeared to produce almost total alleviation of symptoms in 10 to 14 weeks. Later clinical tri- x Foreword als by my own group and clinicians/investigators elsewhere supported the efficacy of this approach for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and panic disorder. ",

This concentration on here-and-now problems appeared to produce almost total alleviation of symptoms in 10 to 14 weeks. Later clinical tri- x Foreword als by my own group and clinicians/investigators elsewhere supported the efficacy of this approach for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and panic disorder. By the mid-1980s, I could claim that cognitive therapy had attained the status of a \u201csystem of psychotherapy.\u201d It consisted of (1) a theory of personality and psychopathology with solid empirical findings to sup- port its basic postulates; (2) a model of psychotherapy, with sets of prin- ciples and strategies that blended with the theory of psychopathology; and (3) solid empirical findings based on clinical outcome studies to support the efficacy of this approach. Since my earlier work, a new generation of therapists/researchers/ teachers has conducted basic investigations of the conceptual model of psychopathology and applied cognitive behavior therapy to a broad spectrum of psychiatric disorders. The systematic investigations explore the basic cognitive dimensions of personality and the psychiatric disor- ders, the idiosyncratic processing and recall of information in these disorders, and the relationship between vulnerability and stress. The applications of cognitive behavior therapy to a host of psy- chological and medical disorders extend far beyond anything I could have imagined when I treated my first few cases of depression and anxiety with cognitive therapy. On the basis of outcome trials, inves- tigators throughout the world, but particularly the United States, have established that cognitive behavior therapy is effective in conditions as diverse as posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, phobias of all kinds, and eating disorders. Often in combination with medication, it has been helpful in the treatment of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Cognitive therapy has also been found to be beneficial in a wide variety of chronic medical disorders such as low back pain, colitis, hypertension, and chronic fatigue syndrome. With a smorgasbord of applications of cognitive behavior therapy, how can an aspiring therapist begin to learn the nuts and bolts of this therapy? Extracting from Alice in Wonderland, \u201cStart at the beginning.\u201d This now brings us back to the question at the beginning of this fore- word. The purpose of this book by Dr. Judith Beck, one of the foremost second-generation cognitive behavior therapists (and who, as a teen- ager, was one of the first to listen to me expound on my new theory), is to provide a solid basic foundation for the practice of cognitive behavior therapy.

The purpose of this book by Dr. Judith Beck, one of the foremost second-generation cognitive behavior therapists (and who, as a teen- ager, was one of the first to listen to me expound on my new theory), is to provide a solid basic foundation for the practice of cognitive behavior therapy. Despite the formidable array of different applications of cog- nitive behavior therapy, they all are based on fundamental principles outlined in this volume. Even experienced cognitive behavior thera- pists should find this book quite helpful in sharpening their conceptu- alization skills, expanding their repertoire of therapeutic techniques, planning more effective treatment, and troubleshooting difficulties in therapy.  Foreword xi Of course, no book can substitute for supervision in cognitive behavior therapy. But this book is an important volume and can be supplemented by supervision, which is readily available from a network of trained cognitive therapists (see Appendix B). Dr. Judith Beck is eminently qualified to offer this guide to cogni- tive behavior therapy. For the past 25 years, she has conducted numer- ous workshops and trainings in cognitive behavior therapy, supervised both beginners and experienced therapists, helped develop treatment protocols for various disorders, and participated actively in research on cognitive behavior therapy. With such a background to draw on, she has written a book with a rich lode of information to apply this therapy, the first edition of which has been the leading cognitive behavior therapy text in most graduate psychology, psychiatry, social work, and counsel- ing programs. The practice of cognitive behavior therapy is not simple. I have observed a number of participants in clinical trials, for example, who can go through the motions of working with \u201cautomatic thoughts,\u201d without any real understanding of the patients\u2019 perceptions of their personal world or any sense of the principle of \u201ccollaborative empiri- cism.\u201d The purpose of Dr. Judith Beck\u2019s book is to educate, to teach, and to train both the novice and the experienced therapist in cognitive behavior therapy, and she has succeeded admirably in this mission. Aaron\u00a0T. Beck, MD Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy Department of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania  xiii Preface T he past two decades have been an exciting time in the field of cog- nitive therapy. With the explosion of new research, cognitive behav- ior therapy has become the treatment of choice for many disorders, not only because it reduces people\u2019s suffering quickly and moves them toward remission, but also because it helps them stay well.

With the explosion of new research, cognitive behav- ior therapy has become the treatment of choice for many disorders, not only because it reduces people\u2019s suffering quickly and moves them toward remission, but also because it helps them stay well. A central mission of our nonprofit organization, the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy, is to provide state-of-the-art training to health and mental health professionals in Philadelphia and throughout the world. But exposure to this type of psychotherapy through workshops and var- ious training programs is not enough. Having trained many thousands of people in the past 25 years, I still find that people need a basic man- ual to read and to which they can repeatedly refer if they are to master the theory, principles, and practice of cognitive behavior therapy. This book is designed for a broad audience of health and mental health professionals, from those who have never been exposed to cog- nitive behavior therapy before to those who are quite experienced but wish to improve their skills, including how to conceptualize patients cognitively, plan treatment, employ a variety of techniques, assess the effectiveness of their treatment, and specify problems that arise in a therapy session. To present the material as simply as possible, I have chosen one patient (whose name and identifying characteristics I have changed) to use as an example throughout the book. Sally is an ideal patient in many ways, and her treatment clearly exemplifies \u201cstandard\u201d cognitive behavior therapy for uncomplicated, single-episode depres- sion. Although the treatment described is for a straightforward case of xiv Preface depression with anxious features, the techniques presented also apply to patients with a wide variety of problems. References for other dis- orders are provided so that the reader can learn to tailor treatment appropriately. The first edition of this book was published in more than 20 lan- guages, and I received feedback from all over the world, much of which I have incorporated into this new edition. I have included new mate- rial on evaluation and behavioral activation, the Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (used in many research studies and training programs to measure therapist competency), and a Cognitive Case Write-Up (based on the template provided by the Academy of Cognitive Ther- apy as a prerequisite to receiving certification).

I have also integrated a greater emphasis on the therapeutic relationship, guided discovery and Socratic questioning, eliciting and using patients\u2019 strengths and resources, and homework. I have been guided by my clinical practice, teaching, and supervision; by research and publications in the field; and by discussions with students and colleagues, from novice to expert, from many different countries, who specialize in various aspects of cog- nitive behavior therapy and in many different disorders. This book could not have been written without the groundbreak- ing work of the father of cognitive therapy, Aaron T. Beck, who is also my father and an extraordinary scientist, theorist, practitioner, and per- son. I have also learned a great deal from every supervisor, supervisee, and patient with whom I have worked. I am grateful to them all. Judith S. Beck, PhD  xv Contents Chapter 1.

Beck, MD, then an assistant professor in psy- chiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Beck was a fully trained and practicing psychoanalyst. A scientist at heart, he believed that in order for psychoanalysis to be accepted by the medical community, its theories needed to be demonstrated as empirically valid. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he embarked on a series of experiments that he fully expected would produce such validation. Instead, the oppo- site occurred. ",

Beck, MD, then an assistant professor in psy- chiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Beck was a fully trained and practicing psychoanalyst. A scientist at heart, he believed that in order for psychoanalysis to be accepted by the medical community, its theories needed to be demonstrated as empirically valid. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he embarked on a series of experiments that he fully expected would produce such validation. Instead, the oppo- site occurred. The results of Dr. Beck\u2019s experiments led him to search for other explanations for depression. He identifi ed distorted, nega- tive cognition (primarily thoughts and beliefs) as a primary feature of depression and developed a short-term treatment, one of whose pri- mary targets was the reality testing of patients\u2019 depressed thinking. In this chapter, you will fi nd the answers to the following ques- tions: What is cognitive behavior therapy? \u2022 How was it developed? \u2022 What does research tell us about its effectiveness? \u2022 What are its basic principles? \u2022 How can you become an effective cognitive behavior therapist? \u2022 2 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND What Is Cognitive Behavior Therapy? Aaron Beck developed a form of psychotherapy in the early 1960s that he originally termed \u201ccognitive therapy.\u201d \u201cCognitive therapy\u201d is now used synonymously with \u201ccognitive behavior therapy\u201d by much of our field and it is this latter term that will be used throughout this volume. Beck devised a structured, short-term, present-oriented psychotherapy for depression, directed toward solving current problems and modify- ing dysfunctional (inaccurate and/or unhelpful) thinking and behavior (Beck, 1964). Since that time, he and others have successfully adapted this therapy to a surprisingly diverse set of populations with a wide range of disorders and problems. These adaptations have changed the focus, techniques, and length of treatment, but the theoretical assumptions themselves have remained constant. In all forms of cognitive behavior therapy that are derived from Beck\u2019s model, treatment is based on a cognitive formulation, the beliefs and behavioral strategies that charac- terize a specific disorder (Alford & Beck, 1997). Treatment is also based on a conceptualization, or understanding, of individual patients (their specific beliefs and patterns of behavior). The therapist seeks in a variety of ways to produce cognitive change\u2014 modification in the patient\u2019s thinking and belief system\u2014to bring about enduring emotional and behavioral change.

The therapist seeks in a variety of ways to produce cognitive change\u2014 modification in the patient\u2019s thinking and belief system\u2014to bring about enduring emotional and behavioral change. Beck drew on a number of different sources when he developed this form of psychotherapy, including early philosophers, such as Epicetus, and theorists, such as Karen Horney, Alfred Adler, George Kelly, Albert Ellis, Richard Lazarus, and Albert Bandura. Beck\u2019s work, in turn, has been expanded by current researchers and theorists, too numerous to recount here, in the United States and abroad. There are a number of forms of cognitive behavior therapy that share characteristics of Beck\u2019s therapy, but whose conceptualizations and emphases in treatment vary to some degree. These include rational emotional behavior therapy (Ellis, 1962), dialectical behavior therapy (Linehan, 1993), problem-solving therapy (D\u2019Zurilla & Nezu, 2006), acceptance and commitment therapy (Hayes, Follette, & Linehan, 2004), exposure therapy (Foa & Rothbaum, 1998), cognitive process- ing therapy (Resick & Schnicke, 1993), cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (McCullough, 1999), behavioral activation (Lewinsohn, Sullivan, & Grosscup, 1980; Martell, Addis, & Jacobson, 2001), cognitive behavior modification (Meichenbaum, 1977), and oth- ers. Beck\u2019s cognitive behavior therapy often incorporates techniques from all these therapies, and other psychotherapies, within a cognitive framework. Historical overviews of the field provide a rich description of how the different streams of cognitive behavior therapy originated  Introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 3 and grew (Arnkoff & Glass, 1992; A. Beck, 2005; Clark, Beck, & Alford, 1999; Dobson & Dozois, 2009; Hollon & Beck, 1993). Cognitive behavior therapy has been adapted for patients with diverse levels of education and income as well as a variety of cultures and ages, from young children to older adults. It is now used in pri- mary care and other medical offices, schools, vocational programs, and prisons, among other settings. It is used in group, couple, and family formats. While the treatment described in this book focuses on individ- ual 45-minute sessions, treatment can be briefer. Some patients, such as those who suffer from schizophrenia, often cannot tolerate a full session, and some practitioners can use cognitive therapy techniques, without conducting a full therapy session, within a medical or rehabili- tation appointment or medication check. What Is the Theory Underlying Cognitive\u00a0Behavior Therapy? In a nutshell, the cognitive model proposes that dysfunctional thinking (which influences the patient\u2019s mood and behavior) is common to all psychological disturbances. When people learn to evaluate their think- ing in a more realistic and adaptive way, they experience improvement in their emotional state and in their behavior. ",

What Is the Theory Underlying Cognitive\u00a0Behavior Therapy? In a nutshell, the cognitive model proposes that dysfunctional thinking (which influences the patient\u2019s mood and behavior) is common to all psychological disturbances. When people learn to evaluate their think- ing in a more realistic and adaptive way, they experience improvement in their emotional state and in their behavior. For example, if you were quite depressed and bounced some checks, you might have an auto- matic thought, an idea that just seemed to pop up in your mind: \u201cI \u00adcan\u2019t do anything right.\u201d This thought might then lead to a particular reac- tion: you might feel sad (emotion) and retreat to bed (behavior). If you then examined the validity of this idea, you might conclude that you had overgeneralized and that, in fact, you actually do many things well. Looking at your experience from this new perspective would probably make you feel better and lead to more functional behavior. For lasting improvement in patients\u2019 mood and behavior, cogni- tive therapists work at a deeper level of cognition: patients\u2019 basic beliefs about themselves, their world, and other people. Modification of their underlying dysfunctional beliefs produces more enduring change. For example, if you continually underestimate your abilities, you might have an underlying belief of incompetence. Modifying this general belief (i.e., seeing yourself in a more realistic light as having both strengths and weaknesses) can alter your perception of specific situations that you encounter daily. You will no longer have as many thoughts with the theme, \u201cI \u00adcan\u2019t do anything right.\u201d Instead, in specific situations where you make mistakes, you will probably think, \u201cI\u2019m not good at this [spe- cific task].\u201d 4 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND What Does the Research Say? Cognitive behavior therapy has been extensively tested since the first outcome study was published in 1977 (Rush, Beck, Kovacs, & Hollon, 1977). At this point, more than 500 outcome studies have demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy for a wide range of psychiatric disorders, psychological problems, and medical problems with psycho- logical components (see, e.g., Butler, Chapman, Forman, & Beck, 2005; Chambless & Ollendick, 2001). Table 1.1 lists many of the disorders and problems that have been successfully treated with cognitive behavior therapy. A more complete list may be found at www.beckinstitute.org. Studies have been conducted that demonstrate the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy in community settings (see, e.g., Shadish, Matt, Navarro & Philips, 2000; Simons et al., 2010; Stirman, Buchhofer, McLaulin, Evans, & Beck, 2009). Other studies have found computer- assisted cognitive behavior therapy to be effective (see, e.g., Khanna & Kendall, 2010; Wright et al., 2002). ",

And several researchers have demonstrated that there are neurobiological changes associated with cognitive behavior therapy treatment for various disorders (see, e.g., TABLE 1.1.\u2002 Partial List of Disorders Successfully Treated by Cognitive Behavior Therapy Psychiatric disorders Psychological problems Medical problems with psychological components Major depressive disorder Geriatric depression Generalized anxiety disorder Geriatric anxiety Panic disorder Agoraphobia Social phobia Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder Conduct disorder Substance abuse Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder Health anxiety Body dysmorphic disorder Eating disorders Personality disorders Sex offenders Habit disorders Bipolar disorder (with medication) Schizophrenia (with medication) Couple problems Family problems Pathological gambling Complicated grief Caregiver distress Anger and hostility Chronic back pain Sickle cell disease pain Migraine headaches Tinnitus Cancer pain Somatoform disorders Irritable bowel syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome Rheumatic disease pain Erectile dysfunction Insomnia Obesity Vulvodynia Hypertension Gulf War syndrome  Introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 5 \u00adGoldapple et al., 2004). Hundreds of research studies have also vali- dated the cognitive model of depression and of anxiety. A comprehen- sive review of these studies can be found in Clark and colleagues (1999) and in Clark and Beck (2010). How Was Beck\u2019s Cognitive Behavior Therapy\u00a0Developed? In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Dr. Beck decided to test the psycho- analytic concept that depression is the result of hostility turned inward toward the self. He investigated the dreams of depressed patients, which, he predicted, would manifest greater themes of hostility than the dreams of normal controls. To his surprise, he ultimately found that the dreams of depressed patients contained fewer themes of hostil- ity and far greater themes of defectiveness, deprivation, and loss. He recognized that these themes paralleled his patients\u2019 thinking when they were awake. The results of other studies Beck conducted led him to believe that a related psychoanalytic idea\u2014that depressed patients have a need to suffer\u2014might be inaccurate (Beck, 1967). At that point, it was almost as if a stacked row of dominoes began to fall. If these psychoanalytic concepts were not valid, how else could depression be understood? As Dr. Beck listened to his patients on the couch, he realized that they occasionally reported two streams of thinking: a free-association stream and quick, evaluative thoughts about themselves. ",

As Dr. Beck listened to his patients on the couch, he realized that they occasionally reported two streams of thinking: a free-association stream and quick, evaluative thoughts about themselves. One woman, for example, detailed her sexual exploits. She then reported feeling anxious. Dr. Beck made an interpretation: \u201cYou thought I was criticiz- ing you.\u201d The patient disagreed: \u201cNo, I was afraid I was boring you.\u201d Upon questioning his other depressed patients, Dr. Beck recognized that all of them experienced \u201cautomatic\u201d negative thoughts such as these, and that this second stream of thoughts was closely tied to their emotions. He began to help his patients identify, evaluate, and respond to their unrealistic and maladaptive thinking. When he did so, they rapidly improved. Dr. Beck then began to teach his psychiatric residents at the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania to use this form of treatment. They, too, found that their patients responded well. The chief resident, A. John Rush, MD, now a leading authority in the field of depression, discussed con- ducting an outcome trial with Dr. Beck. They agreed that such a study was necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of cognitive therapy to others. Their randomized controlled study of depressed patients, published in 1977, established that cognitive therapy was as effective as imipramine, a common antidepressant. This was an astounding study. It was one 6 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND of the first times that a talk therapy had been compared to a medica- tion. Beck, Rush, Shaw, and Emery (1979) published the first cognitive therapy treatment manual 2 years later. Important components of cognitive behavior therapy for depres- sion include a focus on helping patients solve problems; become behaviorally activated; and identify, evaluate, and respond to their depressed thinking, especially to negative thoughts about themselves, their worlds, and their future. In the late 1970s Dr. Beck and his post- doctoral fellows at the University of Pennsylvania began to study anxi- ety, and found that a somewhat different focus was necessary. Patients with anxiety needed to better assess the risk of situations they feared, to consider their internal and external resources, and improve upon their resources. They also needed to decrease their avoidance and con- front situations they feared so they could test their negative predictions behaviorally. ",

Since that time, the cognitive model of anxiety has been refined for each of the various anxiety disorders, cognitive psychology has verified these models, and outcome studies have demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety disorders (Clark & Beck, 2010). Fast-forward several decades. Dr. Beck, his fellows, and other researchers worldwide continue to study, theorize, adapt, and test treat- ments for patients who suffer from an ever-growing list of problems. Cognitive therapy or cognitive behavior therapy is now taught in most graduate schools in the United States and in many other countries. What Are the Basic Principles of Treatment? Although therapy must be tailored to the individual, there are, nev- ertheless, certain principles that underlie cognitive behavior therapy for all patients. Throughout the book, I use a depressed patient, Sally, to illustrate these central tenets and to demonstrate how to use cog- nitive theory to understand patients\u2019 difficulties and how to use this understanding to plan treatment and conduct therapy sessions. Sally is a nearly ideal patient and allows me to present cognitive behavior therapy in a straightforward manner. I make some note of how to vary treatment for patients who do not respond as well as she, but the reader must look elsewhere (e.g., J. S. Beck, 2005; Kuyken, Padesky & Dudley, 2009; Needleman, 1999) to learn how to conceptualize, strategize, and implement techniques for patients with diagnoses other than depres- sion or for patients whose problems pose a challenge in treatment. \u201cSally\u201d was an 18-year-old single female when she sought treatment with me during her second semester of college. She had been  Introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 7 feeling quite depressed and anxious for the previous 4 months and was having difficulty with her daily activities. She met criteria for a major depressive episode of moderate severity according to DSM-IV-TR (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor- ders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision; American Psychiatric Associa- tion, 2000). A fuller portrait of Sally is provided in Appendix A. The basic principles of cognitive behavior therapy are as follows: Principle No. 1. Cognitive behavior therapy is based on an ever-evolving formulation of patients\u2019 problems and an individual conceptualization of each patient in cognitive terms. I consider Sally\u2019s difficulties in three time frames. ",

Cognitive behavior therapy is based on an ever-evolving formulation of patients\u2019 problems and an individual conceptualization of each patient in cognitive terms. I consider Sally\u2019s difficulties in three time frames. From the beginning, I identify her current thinking that contrib- utes to her feelings of sadness (\u201cI\u2019m a failure, I \u00adcan\u2019t do anything right, I\u2019ll never be happy\u201d), and her problematic behaviors (isolating herself, spending a great deal of unproductive time in her room, avoiding ask- ing for help). These problematic behaviors both flow from and in turn reinforce Sally\u2019s dysfunctional thinking. Second, I identify precipitating factors that influenced Sally\u2019s perceptions at the onset of her depression (e.g., being away from home for the first time and struggling in her studies contributed to her belief that she was incompetent). Third, I hypothesize about key developmental events and her enduring patterns of interpreting these events that may have predisposed her to depression (e.g., Sally has had a lifelong tendency to attribute personal strengths and achievement to luck, but views her weaknesses as a reflection of her \u201ctrue\u201d self). I base my conceptualization of Sally on the cognitive formulation of depression and on the data Sally provides at the evaluation session. I continue to refine this conceptualization at each session as I obtain more data. At strategic points, I share the conceptualization with Sally to ensure that it \u201crings true\u201d to her. Moreover, throughout therapy I help Sally view her experience through the cognitive model. She learns, for example, to identify the thoughts associated with her distressing affect and to evaluate and formulate more adaptive responses to her thinking. Doing so improves how she feels and often leads to her behav- ing in a more functional way. Principle No. 2. Cognitive behavior therapy requires a sound therapeu- tic alliance. Sally, like many patients with uncomplicated depression and anxiety disorders, has little difficulty trusting and working with me. I strive to demonstrate all the basic ingredients necessary in a counseling situation: warmth, empathy, caring, genuine regard, and competence. I show my regard for Sally by making empathic statements, listening closely and carefully, and accurately summarizing her thoughts and 8 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND feelings. I point out her small and larger successes and maintain a real- istically optimistic and upbeat outlook. I also ask Sally for feedback at the end of each session to ensure that she feels understood and posi- tive about the session. ",

I also ask Sally for feedback at the end of each session to ensure that she feels understood and posi- tive about the session. See Chapter 2 for a lengthier description of the therapeutic relationship in cognitive behavior therapy. Principle No. 3. Cognitive behavior therapy emphasizes collaboration and active participation. I encourage Sally to view therapy as teamwork; together we decide what to work on each session, how often we should meet, and what Sally can do between sessions for therapy homework. At first, I am more active in suggesting a direction for therapy sessions and in summarizing what \u00adwe\u2019ve discussed during a session. As Sally becomes less depressed and more socialized into treatment, I encourage her to become increasingly active in the therapy session: deciding which prob- lems to talk about, identifying the distortions in her thinking, summa- rizing important points, and devising homework assignments. Principle No. 4. Cognitive behavior therapy is goal oriented and problem focused. I ask Sally in our first session to enumerate her problems and set specific goals so both she and I have a shared understanding of what she is working toward. For example, Sally mentions in the evaluation session that she feels isolated. With my guidance, Sally states a goal in behavioral terms: to initiate new friendships and spend more time with current friends. Later, when discussing how to improve her day-to-day routine, I help her evaluate and respond to thoughts that interfere with her goal, such as: My friends \u00adwon\u2019t want to hang out with me. I\u2019m too tired to go out with them. First, I help Sally evaluate the validity of her thoughts through an examination of the evidence. Then Sally is willing to test the thoughts more directly through behavioral experiments (pages 217\u2013218) in which she initiates plans with friends. Once she recognizes and corrects the distortion in her thinking, Sally is able to benefit from straightforward problem solving to decrease her isolation. Principle No. 5. Cognitive behavior therapy initially emphasizes the pres- ent. The treatment of most patients involves a strong focus on current problems and on specific situations that are distressing to them. Sally begins to feel better once she is able to respond to her negative think- ing and take steps to improve her life. Therapy starts with an examina- tion of here-and-now problems, regardless of diagnosis. Attention shifts to the past in two circumstances. ",

Sally begins to feel better once she is able to respond to her negative think- ing and take steps to improve her life. Therapy starts with an examina- tion of here-and-now problems, regardless of diagnosis. Attention shifts to the past in two circumstances. One, when patients express a strong preference to do so, and a failure to do so could endanger the therapeu- tic alliance. Two, when patients get \u201cstuck\u201d in their dysfunctional think- ing, and an understanding of the childhood roots of their beliefs can potentially help them modify their rigid ideas. (\u201cWell, no wonder you  Introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 9 still believe you\u2019re incompetent. Can you see how almost any child\u2014 who had the same experiences as you\u2014would grow up believing she was incompetent, and yet it might not be true, or certainly not com- pletely true?\u201d) For example, I briefly turn to the past midway through treatment to help Sally identify a set of beliefs she learned as a child: \u201cIf I achieve highly, it means I\u2019m worthwhile,\u201d and \u201cIf I \u00addon\u2019t achieve highly, it means I\u2019m a failure.\u201d I help her evaluate the validity of these beliefs both in the past and present. Doing so leads Sally, in part, to develop more functional and more reasonable beliefs. If Sally had had a personal- ity disorder, I would have spent proportionally more time discussing her developmental history and childhood origin of beliefs and coping behaviors. Principle No. 6. Cognitive behavior therapy is educative, aims to teach the patient to be her own therapist, and emphasizes relapse prevention. In our first session I educate Sally about the nature and course of her dis- order, about the process of cognitive behavior therapy, and about the cognitive model (i.e., how her thoughts influence her emotions and behavior). I not only help Sally set goals, identify and evaluate thoughts and beliefs, and plan behavioral change, but I also teach her how to do so. At each session I ensure that Sally takes home therapy notes\u2014 important ideas she has learned\u2014so she can benefit from her new understanding in the ensuing weeks and after treatment ends. Principle No. 7. Cognitive behavior therapy aims to be time limited. Many straightforward patients with depression and anxiety disorders are treated for six to 14 sessions. Therapists\u2019 goals are to provide symptom relief, facilitate a remission of the disorder, help patients resolve their most pressing problems, and teach them skills to avoid relapse. Sally initially has weekly therapy sessions. ",

Therapists\u2019 goals are to provide symptom relief, facilitate a remission of the disorder, help patients resolve their most pressing problems, and teach them skills to avoid relapse. Sally initially has weekly therapy sessions. (Had her depression been more severe or had she been suicidal, I may have arranged more frequent sessions.) After 2 months, we collaboratively decide to experiment with biweekly sessions, then with monthly sessions. Even after termination, we plan periodic \u201cbooster\u201d sessions every 3 months for a year. Not all patients make enough progress in just a few months, how- ever. Some patients require 1 or 2 years of therapy (or possibly longer) to modify very rigid dysfunctional beliefs and patterns of behavior that contribute to their chronic distress. Other patients with severe mental illness may need periodic treatment for a very long time to maintain stabilization. Principle No. 8. Cognitive behavior therapy sessions are structured. No matter what the diagnosis or stage of treatment, following a certain 10 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND structure in each session maximizes efficiency and effectiveness. This structure includes an introductory part (doing a mood check, briefly reviewing the week, collaboratively setting an agenda for the session), a middle part (reviewing homework, discussing problems on the agenda, setting new homework, summarizing), and a final part (eliciting feed- back). Following this format makes the process of therapy more under- standable to patients and increases the likelihood that they will be able to do self-therapy after termination. Principle No. 9. Cognitive behavior therapy teaches patients to identify, evaluate, and respond to their dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs. Patients can have many dozens or even hundreds of automatic thoughts a day that affect their mood, behavior, and/or physiology (the last is espe- cially pertinent to anxiety). Therapists help patients identify key cog- nitions and adopt more realistic, adaptive perspectives, which leads patients to feel better emotionally, behave more functionally, and/or decrease their physiological arousal. They do so through the process of guided discovery, using questioning (often labeled or mislabeled as \u201cSocratic questioning\u201d) to evaluate their thinking (rather than persua- sion, debate, or lecturing). Therapists also create experiences, called behavioral experiments, for patients to directly test their thinking (e.g., \u201cIf I even look at a picture of a spider, I\u2019ll get so anxious I \u00adwon\u2019t be able to think\u201d). In these ways, therapists engage in collaborative empiricism. ",

In these ways, therapists engage in collaborative empiricism. Therapists do not generally know in advance to what degree a patient\u2019s automatic thought is valid or invalid, but together they test the patient\u2019s thinking to develop more helpful and accurate responses. When Sally was quite depressed, she had many automatic thoughts throughout the day, some of which she spontaneously reported and oth- ers that I elicited (by asking her what was going through her mind when she felt upset or acted in a dysfunctional manner). We often uncovered important automatic thoughts as we were discussing one of Sally\u2019s spe- cific problems, and together we investigated their validity and utility. I asked her to summarize her new viewpoints, and we recorded them in writing so that she could read these adaptive responses throughout the week to prepare her for these or similar automatic thoughts. I did not encourage her to uncritically adopt a more positive viewpoint, chal- lenge the validity of her automatic thoughts, or try to convince her that her thinking was unrealistically pessimistic. Instead we engaged in a collaborative exploration of the evidence. Principle No. 10. Cognitive behavior therapy uses a variety of tech- niques to change thinking, mood, and behavior. Although cognitive strate- gies such as Socratic questioning and guided discovery are central to cognitive behavior therapy, behavioral and problem-solving techniques  Introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 11 are essential, as are techniques from other orientations that are imple- mented within a cognitive framework. For example, I used Gestalt- inspired techniques to help Sally understand how experiences with her family contributed to the development of her belief that she was incom- petent. I use psychodynamically inspired techniques with some Axis II patients who apply their distorted ideas about people to the therapeutic relationship. The types of techniques you select will be influenced by your conceptualization of the patient, the problem you are discussing, and your objectives for the session. These basic principles apply to all patients. Therapy does, however, vary considerably according to individual patients, the nature of their difficulties, and their stage of life, as well as their developmental and intellectual level, gender, and cultural background. Treatment also var- ies depending on patients\u2019 goals, their ability to form a strong thera- peutic bond, their motivation to change, their previous experience with therapy, and their preferences for treatment, among other factors. The emphasis in treatment also depends on the patient\u2019s particu- lar disorder(s). ",

The emphasis in treatment also depends on the patient\u2019s particu- lar disorder(s). Cognitive behavior therapy for panic disorder involves testing the patient\u2019s catastrophic misinterpretations (usually life- or sanity-threatening erroneous predictions) of bodily or mental sensa- tions (Clark, 1989). Anorexia requires a modification of beliefs about personal worth and control (Garner & Bemis, 1985). Substance abuse treatment focuses on negative beliefs about the self and facilitating or permission-granting beliefs about substance use (Beck, Wright, New- man, & Liese, 1993). What Is a Therapy Session Like? The structure of therapy sessions is quite similar for the various disor- ders, but interventions can vary considerably from patient to patient. (The website of the Academy of Cognitive Therapy [www.academyofct. org] posts a list of books that describe the cognitive formulation, major emphases, strategies, and techniques for a wide range of diagnoses, patient variables, and treatment formats and settings.) Below is a gen- eral description of treatment sessions and the course of treatment, especially for patients who are depressed. At the beginning of sessions, you will reestablish the therapeutic alliance, check on patients\u2019 mood, symptoms, and experiences in the past week, and ask them to name the problems they most want help in solving. These difficulties may have arisen during the week and/ or they may be problems patients expect to encounter in the coming week(s). You will also review the self-help activities (\u201chomework\u201d or 12 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND \u201caction plan\u201d) patients engaged in since the previous session. Then, in the context of discussing a specific problem patients have put on the agenda, you will collect data about the problem, cognitively conceptu- alize patients\u2019 difficulties (asking for their specific thoughts, emotions, and behaviors associated with the problem), and collaboratively plan a strategy. The strategy most often includes straightforward problem solving, evaluating patients\u2019 negative thinking associated with the prob- lem, and/or behavior change. For example, Sally, the college student, is having difficulty studying. She needs help evaluating and responding to her thoughts (\u201cWhat\u2019s the use? I\u2019ll probably flunk out anyway\u201d) before she is able to fully engage in solving her problem with studying. I make sure Sally has adopted a more accurate and adaptive view of the situation and has decided which solutions to implement in the coming week (e.g.",

I make sure Sally has adopted a more accurate and adaptive view of the situation and has decided which solutions to implement in the coming week (e.g., starting with relatively easier tasks, mentally summarizing what she has read after every page or two of reading, planning shorter study sessions, going for walks when she takes breaks, and asking the teaching assistant for help). Our ses- sion sets the stage for Sally to make changes in her thinking and behav- ior during the coming week that, in turn, lead to an improvement in her mood and functioning. Having discussed a problem and collaboratively set therapy home- work, Sally and I turn to a second problem she has put on the agenda and repeat the process. At the end of the session we review important points from the session. I make sure that Sally is highly likely to do the homework assignments, and I elicit her feedback about the session. Developing as a Cognitive Behavior Therapist To the untrained observer, cognitive behavior therapy sometimes appears deceptively simple. The cognitive model, the proposition that one\u2019s thoughts influence one\u2019s emotions and behavior, is quite straight- forward. Experienced cognitive behavior therapists, however, accom- plish many tasks at once: conceptualizing the case, building rapport, socializing and educating the patient, identifying problems, collect- ing data, testing hypotheses, and summarizing. The novice cognitive behavior therapist, in contrast, usually needs to be more deliberate and structured, concentrating on fewer elements at one time. Although the ultimate goal is to interweave these elements and conduct therapy as effectively and efficiently as possible, beginners must first learn the skill of developing the therapeutic relationship, the skill of conceptualiza- tion, and the techniques of cognitive behavior therapy, all of which is best done in a step-by-step manner. Developing expertise as a cognitive behavior therapist can be viewed in three stages. (These descriptions assume that the therapist  Introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 13 is already proficient in basic counseling skills: listening, empathy, con- cern, positive regard, and genuineness, as well as accurate understand- ing, reflection, and summarizing. Therapists who do not already possess these skills often elicit a negative reaction from patients.) In Stage 1 you learn basic skills of conceptualizing a case in cognitive terms based on an intake evaluation and data collected in session. ",

In Stage 1 you learn basic skills of conceptualizing a case in cognitive terms based on an intake evaluation and data collected in session. You also learn to structure the session, use your conceptualization of a patient and good common sense to plan treatment, and help patients solve problems and view their dysfunctional thoughts in a different way. You also learn to use basic cognitive and behavioral techniques. In Stage 2 you become more proficient at integrating your con- ceptualization with your knowledge of techniques. You strengthen your ability to understand the flow of therapy. You become more easily able to identify critical goals of treatment and more skillful at conceptual- izing patients, refining your conceptualization during the therapy ses- sion itself, and using the conceptualization to make decisions about interventions. You expand your repertoire of techniques and become more proficient in selecting, timing, and implementing appropriate techniques. In Stage 3 you more automatically integrate new data into the conceptualization. You refine your ability to make hypotheses to con- firm or revise your view of the patient. You vary the structure and tech- niques of basic cognitive behavior therapy as appropriate, particularly for patients with personality disorders and other difficult disorders and problems. If you already practice in another psychotherapeutic modality, it will be important for you to make a collaborative decision with patients to introduce the cognitive behavior therapy approach, describing what you would like to do differently and providing a rationale. Most patients agree to such changes when they are phrased positively, to the patient\u2019s benefit. When patients are hesitant, you can suggest the institution of a change (such as setting an agenda) as an \u201cexperiment,\u201d rather than a commitment, to motivate them to try it. Therapist:\u2002 Mike, I was reading an important book on making therapy more effective and I thought of you. Patient:\u2002 Oh? Therapist:\u2002 Yes, and I have some ideas about how we can help you get better faster. [being collaborative] Is it okay if I tell you about it? Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 One thing I read was called \u201csetting the agenda.\u201d That means at the beginning of sessions, I\u2019m going to ask you tell me the names of problems you want my help in solving during the session.

How to Use this Book This book is intended for individuals at any stage of experience and skill development who lack mastery in the fundamental building blocks of cognitive conceptualization and treatment. It is critical to have mastered the basic elements of cognitive behavior therapy in order to understand how and when to vary standard treatment for individual patients. Your growth as a cognitive behavior therapist will be enhanced if you start applying the tools described in this book to yourself. First, as you read, begin to conceptualize your own thoughts and beliefs. Start paying attention to your own shifts in affect. When you notice that your mood has changed or intensified in a negative direction (or when you notice that you are engaging in dysfunctional behavior or are experi- encing bodily sensations associated with negative affect), ask yourself what emotion you are feeling, as well as the cardinal question of cogni- tive behavior therapy: \u201cWhat was just going through my mind?\u201d In this way, you will teach yourself to identify your own automatic thoughts. Teaching yourself the basic skills of cognitive behavior ther- apy using yourself as the subject will enhance your ability to teach your patients these same skills. It will be particularly useful to identify your automatic thoughts as you are reading this book and trying techniques with your patients. ",

If, for instance, you find yourself feeling slightly distressed, ask yourself, \u201cWhat was just going through my mind?\u201d You may uncover automatic thoughts such as: \u201cThis is too hard.\u201d \u201cI may not be able to master this.\u201d \u201cThis \u00addoesn\u2019t feel comfortable to me.\u201d \u201cWhat if I try it and it \u00addoesn\u2019t work?\u201d  Introduction to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 15 Experienced therapists whose primary orientation has not been cognitive may be aware of a different set of automatic thoughts: \u201cThis \u00adwon\u2019t work.\u201d \u201cThe patient \u00adwon\u2019t like it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s too superficial/structured/unempathic/simple.\u201d Having uncovered your thoughts, you can note them and refocus on your reading, or turn to Chapters 11 and 12, which describe how to evaluate and respond to automatic thoughts. By turning the spotlight on your own thinking, not only can you boost your cognitive behavior therapy skills, but you can also take the opportunity to modify dysfunc- tional thoughts and positively influence your mood (and behavior), making you more receptive to learning. A common analogy used for patients also applies to the beginning cognitive behavior therapist. Learning the skills of cognitive behavior therapy is similar to learning any other skill. Do you remember learn- ing how to drive or how to use a computer? At first, did you feel a little awkward? Did you have to pay a great deal of attention to small details and motions that now come smoothly and automatically to you? Did you ever feel discouraged? As you progressed, did the process make more and more sense, and feel more and more comfortable? Did you finally master it to the point where you were able to perform the task with relative ease and confidence? Most people have had just such an experience learning a skill in which they are now proficient. The learning process is the same for the beginning cognitive behavior therapist. As you will learn to do for your patients, keep your goals small, well-defined, and realistic. Give yourself credit for small gains. Compare your progress to your ability level before you started reading this book, or to the time you first started learning about cog- nitive behavior therapy. ",

Be cognizant of opportunities to respond to negative thoughts in which you unfairly compare yourself to experi- enced cognitive behavior therapists, or in which you undermine your confidence by contrasting your current level of skill with your ultimate objectives. If you feel anxious about starting to use cognitive behavior therapy with patients, make yourself a \u201ccoping card,\u201d an index card on which you have written statements that are important to remember. My psychi- atric residents often have unhelpful thoughts before they see their first outpatient. I ask them to create a card that addresses these thoughts. The card is individualized but generally says something such as: 16 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND My goal is not to cure this patient today. No one expects me to. My goal is to establish a good working alliance, to do some problem solving if I can, and to sharpen my cognitive behavior therapy skills. Reading this card helps reduce their anxiety so that they can focus on their patients and be more effective. Finally, the chapters of this book are designed to be read in the order presented. You might be eager to skip over introductory chapters in order to jump to the sections on techniques. The sum of cognitive behavior therapy, however, is not merely the employment of cognitive and behavioral techniques. Among other attributes, it entails the artful selection and effective utilization of a wide variety of techniques based on one\u2019s conceptualization of the patient. The next chapter provides an overview of treatment, followed by an initial chapter on conceptual- ization. Chapter 4 describes the evaluation process, and Chapters 5\u20138 focus on how to structure and what to do in therapy sessions. Chapters 9\u201314 describe the basic building blocks of cognitive behavior therapy: identifying cognitions and emotions and adaptively responding to auto- matic thoughts and beliefs. Additional cognitive and behavioral tech- niques are provided in Chapter 15, and imagery is discussed in Chap- ter 16. Chapter 17 describes homework. Chapter 18 outlines issues of termination and relapse prevention. These preceding chapters lay the groundwork for Chapters 19 and 20: planning treatment and diagnos- ing problems in therapy. Finally, Chapter 21 offers guidelines in pro- gressing as a cognitive behavior therapist.  ",

They are: Developing the therapeutic relationship. \u2022 Planning treatment and structuring sessions. \u2022 Identifying and responding to dysfunctional cognitions. \u2022 Emphasizing the positive. \u2022 facilitating cognitive and behavioral change between \u2022 sessions (homework). You will also learn more about each of these elements in future chapters. DEVElOPING THE THERAPEUTIC RElATIONSHIP It is essential to start building trust and rapport with patients from your fi rst contact with them. Research demonstrates that positive alliances are correlated with positive treatment outcomes (Raue & Goldfried, 1994). This ongoing process is easily accomplished with most patients 18 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND (although it can be more difficult with patients with severe mental ill- ness or those with strong Axis II pathology). To accomplish this goal, you will: Demonstrate good counseling skills and accurate \u2022 understanding. Share your conceptualization and treatment plan. \u2022 Collaboratively make decisions. \u2022 Seek feedback. \u2022 Vary your style. \u2022 Help patients solve their problems and alleviate their distress. \u2022 Demonstrating Good Counseling Skills You will continuously demonstrate your commitment to and under- standing of patients through your empathic statements, choice of words, tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language. As I tell my trainees, you strive to be a nice human being in the room with patients. You treat them the way you would like to be treated. You demonstrate empathy and accurate comprehension of their problems and ideas through your thoughtful questions, reflections, and statements, which leads to their feeling valued and understood. You will try to impart the following implicit (and sometimes explicit) messages, but only when you genuinely endorse them: \u201cI care about you and value you.\u201d \u201cI want to understand what you are experiencing and help you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m confident we can work well together and that cognitive behavior therapy will help.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not overwhelmed by your problems, even though you might be.\u201d \u00ad\u201cI\u2019ve helped other patients much like you.\u201d If you cannot honestly endorse these messages, you may need help from a supervisor to respond to your automatic thoughts about the patient, about cognitive behavior therapy, or about yourself.

Feel more optimistic, as you present yourself as realistically \u2022 hopeful that treatment will help. Feel a greater sense of self-efficacy, when you help them see \u2022 how much credit they deserve for solving problems, doing homework, and engaging in other productive activities. A common myth about cognitive behavior therapy, held by people who have not read the seminal books or watched videotapes of master clini- cians, is that it is conducted in a cold, mechanical fashion. This is sim- ply inaccurate. In fact, the earliest cognitive behavior therapy manual (Beck et al., 1979) stressed the importance of developing a good thera- peutic relationship. Sharing Your Conceptualization and Treatment Plan You will continuously share your conceptualization with patients and ask them whether it \u201crings true.\u201d For example, a patient may have just described a problem with her mother. You have questioned her to fill in the cognitive model. Then you conceptualize aloud, in summary form. \u201cOkay, I want to make sure I understand. The situation was that your mother yelled at you on the phone for not calling your brother, and your automatic thought was, \u2018She \u00addoesn\u2019t realize how busy I am. She \u00addoesn\u2019t blame him for not calling me.\u2019 These thoughts led you to feel hurt and angry, but you \u00addidn\u2019t say anything back to her [behavior].\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. Did I get that right?\u201d If your conceptualization is accurate, the patient invariably says, \u201cYes, I think that\u2019s right.\u201d If you are wrong, the patient usually says, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not exactly like that. It\u2019s more like\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009.\u201d Eliciting patients\u2019 feedback strengthens the alliance and allows you to more accurately conceptualize them and conduct effective treatment. Making Collaborative Decisions While you guide patients during sessions, you will also actively enlist their participation. You will help them prioritize the problems they want help in solving during a session. ",

You will provide rationales for interven- tions and elicit their approval (\u201cI think it may reduce your stress if you take a rest a couple of times a day\u2014is it okay if we talk about that?\u201d). 20 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND You may suggest, and elicit their reaction to, some self-help activities they can try at home. You continuously act as a team. Seeking Feedback You will be continuously alert for your patients\u2019 emotional reactions throughout the session, observing their facial expressions, body lan- guage, choice of words, and tone of voice. When you recognize that patients are experiencing increased distress, you will often address the issue at the time: \u201cYou look upset. What was just going through your mind?\u201d You may find that patients express negative thoughts about themselves, the process of therapy, or you. As described in Chapter 8, it is important to positively reinforce patients for providing feedback, then conceptualize the problem and plan a strategy to solve it. Failure to identify and address patients\u2019 negative feedback reduces their ability to focus on solving their real-life difficulties and feel better. They may even decide not to return to therapy the following week. (See J. S. Beck, 2005, for an extensive discussion of solving problems in the therapeutic relationship.)

For example, a patient may perceive you as being overly caring or too \u201ctouchy-feely.\u201d Watching for patients\u2019 emotional reactions in the session can alert you to ask questions to elicit a problem such as this, so you can change how you present yourself and help the patient feel more comfortable working with you. Helping Patients Alleviate Their Distress One of the best ways to strengthen the therapeutic relationship is by being an effective and competent cognitive behavior therapist. Research has demonstrated that the therapeutic alliance becomes strengthened  Overview of Treatment 21 when patients\u2019 symptomatology is reduced (DeRubeis & Feeley, 1990; Feeley, DeRubeis, & Gelfand, 1999). In general, you will spend enough time developing the therapeu- tic relationship to engage patients in working effectively with you as a team, and you will use the therapeutic alliance to provide evidence to patients that their core beliefs are incorrect. If the alliance is sound, you will avoid spending additional unnecessary time in order to maximize the time you spend helping patients solve problems they will face in the coming week. Some patients, particularly those with personality disor- ders, do require a far greater emphasis on the therapeutic relationship and advanced strategies to forge a good working alliance (Beck, Free- man, Davis, & Associates, 2004; J. S. Beck, 2005; Young, 1999). Planning Treatment and Structuring Sessions A major goal of treatment is to make the process of therapy understand- able to you and the patient. You will try to conduct therapy as efficiently as possible, so you can alleviate the patient\u2019s suffering as quickly as pos- sible. Adhering to a standard format (as well as teaching the tools of therapy to the patient) facilitates these objectives. But, as noted above, you will not deliver treatment in a rote or impersonal way\u2014if you did, you would not be very effective. Most patients feel more comfortable when they know what to expect from therapy, when they clearly understand what you want them to do, when they feel that you and they are a team, and when they have a con- crete idea of how therapy will proceed, both within a session and over the course of treatment.

You will maximize the patient\u2019s understanding by explaining the general structure of sessions and then adhering (flex- ibly at times) to that structure. You will begin to plan treatment for a session before patients enter your office. You will quickly review their chart, especially their goals for treatment and the therapy notes and homework assignments from the previous session(s). As noted above, you will have a general idea of how you intend to structure the session. The overarching therapeutic goal is to improve the patient\u2019s mood during the session and to create a plan so the patient can feel better and behave more functionally during the week. What you will do specifically in the session will be influenced by patients\u2019 symptoms, your conceptualization, the strength of the thera- peutic alliance, their stage of treatment, and, especially, the problems they put on the agenda. Your goal in the first part of a therapy session is to reestablish the therapeutic alliance and collect data so you and the patient can collab- 22 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND oratively set and prioritize the agenda. In the second part of a session, you and the patient will discuss the problems on the agenda. In the con- text of solving these problems, you will teach the patient relevant cogni- tive, behavioral, problem-solving, and other skills. You will continually reinforce the cognitive model, help patients evaluate and respond to their automatic thoughts, do problem solving, and ask them to summa- rize their new understandings. These kinds of discussions and interventions naturally lead to homework assignments, which usually involve having patients remind themselves of their new, more realistic way of thinking about the prob- lem and implementing solutions during the week. One important ongo- ing assignment is to have patients identify and respond to their dysfunc- tional thinking throughout the week, when they notice their mood is getting worse, they are behaving in a dysfunctional way, and/or they are experiencing significant physiological arousal. In the final part of the session, you will elicit from patients what they thought were the most important points of the session, ensure that these ideas are written down, review (and modify if necessary) the homework assignments, and elicit and respond to patients\u2019 feedback about the session.

While experienced cognitive behavior therapists may deviate from this format at times, novice therapists are usually more effective when they follow the specified structure. Further descriptions of the structure of therapy sessions appear in Chapters 5, 7, and 8. To structure sessions effectively, you will need to gently interrupt patients: \u201cOh, can I interrupt you for a moment? Are you saying.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009?\u201d Strategically and skillfully interrupting patients is illustrated in later chapters. If you initially feel awkward with a more tightly structured session, you will most likely find that the process gradually becomes second nature, especially when you note the positive results. Identifying and Responding to\u00a0Dysfunctional\u00a0Cognitions An important part of nearly every therapy session is to help patients respond to their inaccurate or unhelpful ideas: their automatic thoughts, images (mental pictures), and/or underlying beliefs. You can identify important automatic thoughts in several ways (see Chapter 9), but you will usually ask a basic question when a patient is reporting a distressing situation or emotion, or dysfunctional behavior: \u201cWhat is going through your mind right now?\u201d  Overview of Treatment 23 Next, you will help patients evaluate their thinking in two major ways: You will engage in a process of \u2022 guided discovery to help patients develop a more adaptive and reality-based perspective. You will jointly design \u2022 behavioral experiments to test patients\u2019 pre- dictions whenever feasible. Guided Discovery Usually in the context of discussing a problem, you elicit patients\u2019 cog- nitions (automatic thoughts, images, and/or beliefs). You will often ascertain which cognition or cognitions are most upsetting to patients, then ask them a series of questions to help them gain distance (i.e., see their cognitions as ideas, not necessarily as truths), evaluate the valid- ity and utility of their cognitions, and/or decastastrophize their fears. Questions such as the following are often helpful: \u201cWhat is the evidence that your thought is true? What is the evidence on the other side?\u201d \u201cWhat is an alternative way of viewing this situation?\u201d \u201cWhat is the worst that could happen, and how could you cope if it did? What\u2019s the best that could happen? ",

But these questions are a useful guide, and are illustrated in the following transcript, excerpted from Sally\u2019s fourth therapy session. I help Sally specify a problem that is important to her, identify and eval- uate an associated dysfunctional idea, devise a reasonable plan, and assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, Sally, you said you wanted to talk about a problem with finding a part-time job? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. I need the money\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. but I \u00addon\u2019t know. 24 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 (noticing that Sally looks more dysphoric) What\u2019s going through your mind right now? Patient:\u2002 [automatic thought] I \u00adwon\u2019t be able to handle a job. Therapist:\u2002 [labeling her idea as a thought and linking it to her mood] And how does that thought make you feel? Patient:\u2002 [emotion] Sad. Really low. Therapist:\u2002 [beginning to evaluate the thought] What\u2019s the evidence that you \u00adwon\u2019t be able to work? Patient:\u2002 Well, I\u2019m having trouble just getting through my classes. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. What else? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019m still so tired. It\u2019s hard to make myself even go and look for a job, much less go to work every day. Therapist:\u2002 In a minute we\u2019ll look at that. [suggesting an alterna- tive view] Maybe it\u2019s actually harder for you at this point to go out and investigate jobs than it would be for you to go to a job that you already\u00a0had. In any case, is there any other evidence that you \u00adcouldn\u2019t handle a job, assuming that you can get one? Patient:\u2002 .\u2009.\u2009. No, not that I can think of. Therapist:\u2002 Any evidence on the other side? That you might be able to handle a job? Patient:\u2002 I did work last year. And that was on top of school and other activities. But this year\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I just \u00addon\u2019t know. ",

It\u2019s possible I could do something that \u00addoesn\u2019t take much time. And that \u00adisn\u2019t too hard. Therapist:\u2002 What might that be? Patient:\u2002 A sales job, maybe. I did that last year. Therapist:\u2002 Any ideas of where you could work? Patient:\u2002 Actually, maybe the [university] bookstore. I saw a notice that they\u2019re looking for new clerks. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. And what would be the worst that could happen if you did get a job at the bookstore? Patient:\u2002 I guess if I \u00adcouldn\u2019t do it. Therapist:\u2002 And if that happened, how would you cope? Patient:\u2002 I guess I\u2019d just quit. Therapist:\u2002 And what would be the best that could happen? Patient:\u2002 Uh\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. that I\u2019d be able to do it easily.  Overview of Treatment 25 Therapist:\u2002 And what\u2019s the most realistic outcome? Patient:\u2002 It probably \u00adwon\u2019t be easy, especially at first. But I might be able to do it. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, what\u2019s the effect of believing your thought, \u201cI \u00adwon\u2019t be able to handle a job\u201d? Patient:\u2002 Makes me feel sad.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. Makes me not even try. Therapist:\u2002 And what\u2019s the effect of changing your thinking, of real- izing that possibly you could work in the bookstore? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019d feel better. I\u2019d be more likely to apply for the job. Therapist:\u2002 So what do you want to do about this? Patient:\u2002 Go to the bookstore. I could go this afternoon. Therapist:\u2002 How likely are you to go? Patient:\u2002 Oh, I guess I will. I will go. Therapist:\u2002 And how do you feel now? Patient:\u2002 A little better. A little more nervous, maybe. But a little more hopeful, I guess. Here Sally is easily able to identify and evaluate her dysfunctional thought, \u201cI \u00adwon\u2019t be able to handle a job,\u201d with standard questions. Many patients, though, may require far more therapeutic effort before they are willing to follow through behaviorally. Had Sally been hesitant, I might have asked her to summarize what we had discussed and then we may have jointly composed a coping card based on her summary, that might have said something such as: If I avoid going to the bookstore, remind myself that I probably could handle a job there and I could always quit if it \u00addidn\u2019t work out.

It\u2019s not a big deal. 26 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Behavioral Experiments Whenever possible, you will collaboratively design experiments that patients can conduct right in the therapy session itself (as well as between sessions). Discussing the validity of patients\u2019 ideas, as described above, can help them change their thinking, but the change may be signifi- cantly more profound if the cognition is amenable to a behavioral test, that is, if the patient can have an experience that disconfirms its valid- ity (Bennett-Levy et al., 2004). Suitable cognitions are usually linked to patients\u2019 negative predictions. A depressed patient, for example, might have the automatic thought, \u201cIf I try to read anything, I \u00adwon\u2019t be able to concentrate well enough to understand it.\u201d You might ask the patient to read a short passage from a book in your office to see to what degree this thought is valid. An anxious patient may express the thought, \u201cIf I tell you about the abuse, I\u2019ll be so upset, I\u2019ll fall apart,\u201d or \u201cIf I get anxious and my heart starts to pound, I\u2019ll have a heart attack.\u201d You will collaboratively design experiments to test these kinds of ideas. At the beginning of treatment, you will generally focus on situation- specific thoughts, which are usually amenable to change. Toward the middle of therapy, you will continue to work at the automatic thought level, but you will also focus on modifying patients\u2019 more generalized cognitions: their underlying assumptions and core beliefs. (These vari- ous levels of cognition are described at length in the next chapter.) Treatment continues, ideally, until patients\u2019 disorders are in remission and they have learned the necessary skills to prevent relapse. Emphasizing the Positive Most patients, especially those with depression, tend to focus unduly on the negative. When they are in a depressive mode, they automati- cally (i.e., without conscious awareness) and selectively attend to and put great emphasis on negative experience, and they either discount or fail to recognize more positive experience. Their difficulty in process- ing positive data in a straightforward manner leads them to develop a distorted sense of reality. To counteract this feature of depression, you will continually help patients attend to the positive. At the evaluation, you will elicit patients\u2019 strengths (\u201cWhat are some of your strengths and positive qualities?\u201d). ",

You will orient sessions toward the positive, helping patients have a better week. You will use the therapeutic alliance to demonstrate that you view patients as valuable human beings (\u201cI think it\u2019s great that you  Overview of Treatment 27 talked to the teacher [of the child you were tutoring] to see whether he could get more help\u201d). You will ask patients for data that is contrary to their negative automatic thoughts and beliefs (\u201cWhat\u2019s the [positive] evidence on the other side, that perhaps your automatic thought \u00adisn\u2019t true?\u201d). You will point out the positive data you hear as patients discuss problems and ask what this data means about them (\u201cWhat does this say about you, that you got the job in the bookstore?\u201d). You will be on alert for, and note aloud, instances of positive coping that patients may allude to throughout the session (\u201cWhat a good idea, to solve the problem by asking Allison to study with you\u201d). You will collaboratively set homework assignments with patients to facilitate their experienc- ing a sense of pleasure and achievement. Methods of conceptualizing and incorporating patients\u2019 strengths as well as building resilience are described in Kuyken et al. (2009). Facilitating Cognitive and Behavioral Change Between Sessions (Homework) An important aim of treatment is to help patients feel better by the end of the session and to set them up to have a better week. To achieve this objective, you will: Help patients evaluate and respond to automatic thoughts \u2022 that they are likely to experience between sessions. Help patients devise solutions to their problems to \u2022 implement during the week. Teach patients new skills to practice during the week. \u2022 Because patients tend to forget much of what occurs in therapy sessions, it is important that anything you want them to remember be recorded so they can review it at home. Either you or they should write down their self-help assignments in a therapy notebook (which you can photocopy and attach to your treatment notes) or on carbonless paper (available from office supply stores or printers). Homework usually con- sists of: Behavioral changes as a result of problem solving and/or skills \u2022 training in session (e.g.",

Identifying automatic thoughts and beliefs when patients notice a \u2022 dysfunctional change in affect, behavior, or physiology, and then evaluating and responding to their cognitions through Socratic questioning, behavioral experiments, and/or reading therapy notes that address their cognitions. For example: If I start to think that I \u00adcan\u2019t clean up the kitchen, remind myself that I\u2019m only going to do it for 10 minutes, that it may be difficult but probably \u00adwon\u2019t be impossible, and that the first minute or two will probably be the hardest, and then it\u2019s likely to get easier. Homework naturally flows from the discussion of each problem, because the patient will have things to remember (changes in cogni- tion) and/or things to do. It is of utmost importance to plan home- work assignments carefully, crafting them for your patient based on your conceptualization of what will help most, along with the patient\u2019s agreement. It is also essential to review homework the following week. An important early assignment for patients with depression is schedul- ing activities. See Chapter 6 for a detailed description of activity sched- uling and Chapter 17 for detailed guidelines in setting and reviewing homework.  29 Chapter 3 COGNITIVE CONCEPTUAlIzATION A cognitive conceptualization provides the framework for under- standing a patient. To initiate the process of formulating a case, you will ask yourself the following questions: \u201cWhat is the patient\u2019s diagnosis(es)?\u201d \u201cWhat are his current problems? How did these problems develop and how are they maintained?\u201d \u201cWhat dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs are associated with the problems? What reactions (emotional, physiological, and behavioral) are associated with his thinking?\u201d Then you will hypothesize how the patient developed this particu- lar psychological disorder: \u201cHow does the patient view himself, others, his personal world, his future?\u201d \u201cWhat are the patient\u2019s underlying beliefs (including attitudes, expectations, and rules) and thoughts?\u201d \u201cHow is the patient coping with his dysfunctional cognitions?\u201d 30 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND \u201cWhat stressors (precipitants) contributed to the development of his current psychological problems, or interfere with solving these problems?\u201d \u201cIf relevant, what early experiences may have contributed to the patient\u2019s current problems?

This organic, evolving formulation helps you plan for efficient and effective therapy (Kuyken et al., 2009; Needle- man, 1999; Persons, 2008; Tarrier, 2006). In this chapter I describe the cognitive model, the theoretical basis of cognitive behavior therapy. I then discuss the relationship of thoughts and beliefs and present the case example of Sally, used throughout this book. The Cognitive Model Cognitive behavior therapy is based on the cognitive model, which hypoth- esizes that people\u2019s emotions, behaviors, and physiology are influenced by their perception of events. Situation/event \uf090 Automatic thoughts \uf090 Reaction (emotional, behavioral, physiological) It is not a situation in and of itself that determines what people feel, but rather how they construe a situation (Beck, 1964; Ellis, 1962). Imag- ine, for example, a situation in which several people are reading a basic text on cognitive behavior therapy. They have quite different emotional and behavioral responses to the same situation, based on what is going through their minds as they read.  Cognitive Conceptualization 31 Reader A thinks, \u201cThis really makes sense. Finally, a book that will really teach me to be a good therapist!\u201d Reader A feels mildly excited and keeps reading.

The way people feel emotionally and the way they behave are asso- ciated with how they interpret and think about a situation. The situation itself does not directly determine how they feel or what they do; their emotional response is mediated by their perception of the situation. Cognitive behavior therapists are particularly interested in the level of thinking that may operate simultaneously with a more obvious, surface level of thinking. For example, while you are reading this text, you may notice two levels in your thinking. Part of your mind is focusing on the informa- tion in the text; that is, you are trying to understand and integrate the information. At another level, however, you may be having some quick, evaluative thoughts. These thoughts are called automatic thoughts and are not the result of deliberation or reasoning. Rather, these thoughts seem to spring up spontaneously; they are often quite rapid and brief. You may barely be aware of these thoughts; you are far more likely to be aware of the emotion or behavior that follows. Even if you are aware of your thoughts, you most likely accept them uncritically, believing that they are true. You \u00addon\u2019t even think of questioning them. You can learn, however, to identify your automatic thoughts by attending to your shifts in affect, your behavior, and/or your physiology. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat was just going through my mind?\u201d when: 32 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND You begin to feel dysphoric. \u2022 You feel inclined to behave in a dysfunctional way (or to avoid \u2022 behaving in an adaptive way). You notice distressing changes in your body or mind. \u2022 Having identified your automatic thoughts, you can, and probably already do to some extent, evaluate the validity of your thinking. For example, if you have a lot to do, you may have the automatic thought, \u201cI\u2019ll never get it all finished.\u201d But you may do an automatic reality check, recalling past experiences and reminding yourself, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You know you always get done what you need to.\u201d When you find your interpre- tation of a situation is erroneous and you correct it, you probably dis- cover that your mood improves, you behave in a more functional way, and/or your physiological arousal decreases.

In cognitive terms, when dysfunctional thoughts are subjected to objective reflection, one\u2019s emo- tions, behavior, and physiological reaction generally change. Chapter 11 offers specific guidelines on how to evaluate automatic thoughts. But where do automatic thoughts spring from? What makes one person construe a situation differently from another person? Why may the same person interpret an identical event differently at one time than at another? The answer has to do with more enduring cognitive phenomena: beliefs. Beliefs Beginning in childhood, people develop certain ideas about them- selves, other people, and their world. Their most central or core beliefs are enduring understandings so fundamental and deep that they often do not articulate them, even to themselves. The person regards these ideas as absolute truths\u2014just the way things \u201care\u201d (Beck, 1987). For example, Reader E, who thought he was too unintelligent to master this text, frequently has a similar concern when he has to engage in a new task (e.g., learning a new skill on the computer, figuring out how to put together a bookcase, or applying for a bank loan). He seems to have the core belief, \u201cI\u2019m incompetent.\u201d This belief may operate only when he is in a depressed state, or it may be activated much of the time. When this core belief is activated, Reader E interprets situations through the lens of this belief, even though the interpretation may, on a rational basis, be patently invalid. Reader E tends to focus selectively on information that confirms his core belief, disregarding or discounting information to the con-  Cognitive Conceptualization 33 trary. For example, Reader E did not consider that other intelligent, competent people might not fully understand the material in their first reading. Nor did he entertain the possibility that the author had not presented the material well. He did not recognize that his difficulty in comprehension could be due to a lack of concentration, rather than a lack of brainpower. He forgot that he often had difficulty initially when presented with a body of new information, but later had a good track record of mastery. Because his incompetence belief was activated, he automatically interpreted the situation in a highly negative, self-critical way. In this way, his belief is maintained, even though it is inaccurate and dysfunctional. ",

Because his incompetence belief was activated, he automatically interpreted the situation in a highly negative, self-critical way. In this way, his belief is maintained, even though it is inaccurate and dysfunctional. It is important to note that he is not purposely try- ing to process information in this way; it occurs automatically. Figure 3.1 illustrates this distorted way of processing information. The circle with a rectangular opening represents Reader E\u2019s schema. In Piagetian terms, the schema is a hypothesized mental structure that organizes information. Within this schema is Reader E\u2019s core belief: \u201cI\u2019m incompetent.\u201d When Reader E is presented with negative data this schema becomes activated, and the data, contained in negative rect- angles, are immediately processed as confirming his core belief, which makes the belief stronger. But a different process occurs when Reader E is presented with posi- tive data (such as analyzing which health care plan would be best for his family). Positive data are encoded in the equivalent of positive triangles, which cannot fit into the schema. His mind automatically discounts the data (\u201cI chose a health care plan, but it took me a long time.\u201d) When his boss praised him, he immediately thought, \u201cMy boss is wrong. I \u00addidn\u2019t do that project well. I \u00addidn\u2019t deserve it [his praise].\u201d These interpreta- tions, in essence, change the shape of the data from positive triangles to negative rectangles. Now the data fit into the schema and, as a result, strengthen the negative core belief. There are also positive data that Reader E just does not notice. He does not negate some evidence of competence, such as paying his bills on time or fixing a plumbing problem. Rather, he does not seem to process these positive data at all; they bounce off the schema. Over time, Reader E\u2019s core belief of incompetence becomes stronger and stronger. Sally, too, has a core belief of incompetence. Fortunately, when she\u00a0 is not depressed a different schema (which contains the core belief, \u201cI\u2019m reasonably competent\u201d) is activated much, but not all, of the time.\u00a0But when she is depressed, the incompetence schema pre- dominates. One important part of therapy is to help Sally view negative data in a more realistic and adaptive way. Another important part of therapy is to help her identify and process positive data in a straight- forward way. 34 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Core beliefs are the most fundamental level of belief; they are global, rigid, and overgeneralized.

Automatic thoughts, the actual words or images that go through a person\u2019s mind, are situation specific and may be considered the most superficial level of cognition. The following section describes the class of intermediate beliefs that exists between the two. \u2013 Difficulty with new computer skills \u2013 Difficulty applying for loan \u2013 But I didn\u2019t deserve it \u2013 But it took me a long time + Praise from boss + Chose health plan + Paid bills on time + Fixed plumbing problem I\u2019m incompetent. FIGURE 3.1.\u2002 Information-processing model. This diagram demonstrates how negative data are immediately processed, strengthening the core belief, while posi- tive data are discounted (changed into negative data) or unnoticed.  Cognitive Conceptualization 35 Attitudes, Rules, and Assumptions Core beliefs influence the development of an intermediate class of beliefs, which consists of (often unarticulated) attitudes, rules, and assumptions. Reader E, for example, had the following intermediate beliefs: Attitude: \u201cIt\u2019s terrible to fail.\u201d Rule: \u201cGive up if a challenge seems too great.\u201d Assumptions: \u201cIf I try to do something difficult, I\u2019ll fail. If I avoid doing it, I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d These beliefs influence his view of a situation, which in turn influ- ences how he thinks, feels, and behaves. The relationship of these intermediate beliefs to core beliefs and automatic thoughts is depicted below: Core beliefs \uf090 Intermediate beliefs (rules, attitudes, assumptions) \uf090 Automatic thoughts How do core beliefs and intermediate beliefs arise? People try to make sense of their environment from their early developmental stages. They need to organize their experience in a coherent way in order to function adaptively (Rosen, 1988). Their interactions with the world and other people, influenced by their genetic predisposition, lead to certain understandings: their beliefs, which may vary in their accuracy and functionality. Of particular significance to the cognitive behavior therapist is that dysfunctional beliefs can be unlearned, and more real- ity-based and functional new beliefs can be developed and strength- ened through treatment. The quickest way to help patients feel better and behave more adaptively is to facilitate the direct modification of their core beliefs as soon as possible, because once they do so, patients will tend to interpret future situations or problems in a more constructive way.

It is possible to undertake belief modification earlier in treatment with patients who have straightforward depression and who held reasonable and adaptive beliefs about themselves before the onset of their disorder. But when patients\u2019 beliefs are entrenched, you can lose credibility and endanger 36 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND the therapeutic alliance if you question the validity of core beliefs too early. The usual course of treatment in cognitive behavior therapy, there- fore, involves an initial emphasis on identifying and modifying auto- matic thoughts that derive from the core beliefs (and on interventions that indirectly modify core beliefs). Therapists teach patients to iden- tify these cognitions that are closest to conscious awareness, and to gain distance from them by learning: Just because they believe something \u00addoesn\u2019t necessarily mean it \u2022 is true. Changing their thinking so it is more reality based and useful \u2022 helps them feel better and progress toward their goals. It is easier for patients to recognize the distortion in their specific thoughts than in their broad understandings of themselves, their worlds, and others. But through repeated experiences in which they gain relief by working at a more superficial level of cognition, patients become more open to evaluating the beliefs that underlie their dysfunctional thinking. Relevant intermediate-level beliefs and core beliefs are evalu- ated in various ways and subsequently modified so that patients\u2019 percep- tions of and conclusions about events change. This deeper modification of more fundamental beliefs makes patients less likely to relapse (Evans et al., 1992; Hollon, DeRubeis, & Seligman, 1992). Relationship of Behavior to\u00a0Automatic\u00a0Thoughts The hierarchy of cognition, as it has been explained to this point, can be illustrated as follows: Core beliefs \uf090 Intermediate beliefs (rules, attitudes, assumptions) \uf090 Situation \uf090 Automatic thoughts \uf090 Reaction (emotional, behavioral, physiological)  Cognitive Conceptualization 37 In a specific situation, one\u2019s underlying beliefs influence one\u2019s per- ception, which is expressed by situation-specific automatic thoughts. These thoughts, in turn, influence one\u2019s emotional, behavioral, and physiological reaction. Figure 3.2 illustrates the cognitive concep\u00ad tualization of Reader E in this particular situation, illustrating how his\u00a0beliefs influence his thinking, which in turns influences his reac- tion. Note that had Reader E been able to evaluate his thinking, his emo- tions, physiology, and behavior may have been positively affected.

To summarize, this reader felt discouraged because of his thoughts in a particular situation. Why did he have these thoughts when another reader did not? Unarticulated core beliefs about his incompetence influenced his perception of the situation. FIGURE 3.2.\u2002 Cognitive conceptualization of Reader E.

Thinking, mood, behavior, physiology, and the environment all can affect one another. Triggering situations can be: Discrete events (such as getting a low mark on a paper). \u2022 A stream of thoughts (such as thinking about doing schoolwork \u2022 or intrusive thoughts). A memory (such as getting a poor grade in the past). \u2022 An image (such as the disapproving face of a professor). \u2022 An emotion (such as noticing how intense one\u2019s dysphoria is). \u2022 A behavior (such as staying in bed). \u2022 A physiological or mental experience (such as noticing one\u2019s \u2022 rapid heartbeat or slowed-down thinking). There may be a complex sequence of events with many different trig- gering situations, automatic thoughts, and reactions, as pictured in Fig- ure 3.3. ",

As explained in the beginning of this chapter, it is essential for you to learn to conceptualize patients\u2019 difficulties in cognitive terms in order to determine how to proceed in therapy\u2014when to work on a specific problem or goal, automatic thought, belief, or behavior; what techniques to choose; and how to improve the therapeutic relationship. The basic questions to ask yourself are: \u201cHow did this patient end up here?\u201d \u201cWhat vulnerabilities were significant?\u201d \u201cHow has the patient coped with her vulnerability?\u201d \u201cDid certain life events (traumas, experiences, interactions) predispose her to her current difficulties?\u201d \u201cWhat are the patient\u2019s automatic thoughts, and what beliefs did they spring from?\u201d It is important to put yourself in your patients\u2019 shoes, to develop empathy for what they are undergoing, to understand how they are feel- ing, and to perceive the world through their eyes. Given their history  Cognitive Conceptualization 39 and set of beliefs, their perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and behavior should make sense. It is helpful to view therapy as a journey, and the conceptualization as the road map. You and the patient discuss the goals of therapy, the final destination. There are a number of ways to reach that destina- tion: for example, by main highways or back roads. Sometimes detours change the original plan. As you become more experienced and better at conceptualization, you fill in the relevant details in the map, and Situation: Sally feels exhausted (physiological trigger) when she wakes up. \uf090 Automatic thought: \u201cI\u2019m too tired to get up.

FIGURE 3.3.\u2002 Complex cognitive model sequence. 40 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND your efficiency and effectiveness improve. At the beginning, however, it is reasonable to assume that you may not accomplish therapy in the most effective or efficient way. An accurate cognitive conceptualization aids you in determining what the main highways are and how best to travel. Conceptualization begins at the first contact with patients and is refined at every subsequent contact. You make hypotheses about patients, based not just on the cognitive formulation of the case, but also on the specific data patients present. You confirm, disconfirm, or modify your hypotheses as patients present new data. The conceptualization, there- fore, is fluid. At strategic points, you will directly check your hypotheses and formulation with patients. Generally, if the conceptualization is on target, patients confirm that it \u201cfeels right\u201d\u2014they agree that the picture the therapist presents truly resonates with them. Sally, for example, suffered from persistent sadness, anxiety, and loneliness. As part of her intake evaluation, I elicited a sampling of her automatic thoughts. I asked Sally when she generally was most dis- tressed\u2014in which situations or times of day. Sally replied that she felt worst at bedtime, as she lay in bed, trying to fall asleep. Having ascer- tained that the previous night was a typical example, I asked the key question: \u201cWhat was going through your mind last night, as you were lying in bed, trying to fall asleep?\u201d Sally replied, \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to finish my term paper. I\u2019ll probably flunk out of here. I\u2019ll never be able to make anything of myself.\u201d Sally also reported an image, an automatic thought in a pictorial form, which flashed through her mind. She saw herself, weighed down by a heavy backpack, trudging aimlessly down the street, looking quite downtrodden, directionless, and desperate. During the course of therapy, I rounded out my conceptualization. I organized my thinking through the use of a Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram (page 200) and a Cognitive Case Write-Up (Appendix A).

Sally\u2019s Core Beliefs As a child, Sally tried to make sense of herself, others, and her world. She learned through her own experiences, through interactions with others, through direct observation, and through others\u2019 explicit and implicit messages to her. Her perceptions were also undoubtedly influ- enced by her genetic inheritance. Sally had a highly achieving older brother. As a young child, she perceived that she could not do anything as well as her brother and started to believe, although she did not put it into words, that she was incompetent and inferior. She kept comparing her performance to that of her brother and invariably came up lacking. She frequently had thoughts such as: \u201cI \u00adcan\u2019t draw like Robert can.\u201d \u201cHe  Cognitive Conceptualization 41 rides his bike better than I do.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never be as good a reader as he is. He does everything better than I do.\u201d Not all children with older siblings develop these kinds of dys- functional beliefs. But Sally\u2019s ideas were reinforced by her mother, who frequently criticized her: \u201cYou did a terrible job straightening up your room. \u00adCan\u2019t you do anything right?\u201d \u201cYour brother got a good report card. But you? You\u2019ll never amount to anything.\u201d Sally, like most chil- dren, placed enormous stock in her mother\u2019s words, believing that her mother was correct about nearly everything. So when her mother criti- cized her, implying or directly stating that Sally was incompetent, Sally believed her. At school, Sally also compared herself to her peers. While she was an above-average student, she compared herself only to the best stu- dents, again coming up short. She had thoughts such as: \u201cI\u2019m not as good as they are.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to understand all this as well as they can.\u201d So the idea that she was incompetent and inferior was rein- forced. Without recognizing that she was doing so, Sally often screened out or discounted positive information that contradicted these ideas. When she got a high mark on a test, she would tell herself, \u201cThe test was easy.\u201d When she learned ballet and became one of the better dancers in the group, she thought, \u201cI\u2019ll never be as good as my teacher.\u201d She usually made negative interpretations, thereby confirming her dysfunctional beliefs. For example, when her mother yelled at her for getting a B on a test, she thought, \u201cMom\u2019s right. I am stupid.\u201d She consistently inter- preted negative events as demonstrating her shortcomings. ",

In addition, when she experienced positive events such as winning an award, she often discounted them: \u201cI was just lucky. It was a fluke.\u201d This process led to Sally\u2019s developing a negative core belief about herself. Sally\u2019s negative beliefs were not rock solid, however. Her father, although he traveled for business and was home only intermittently, was generally encouraging and supportive. When he taught her to hit a baseball, for example, he would praise her efforts. \u201cThat\u2019s good\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. good swing\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. you\u2019re getting it\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. keep going.\u201d Some of Sally\u2019s teachers, too, praised her performance in school. Sally also had positive experi- ences with friends. She saw that if she tried hard, she could do some things better than her friends could\u2014baseball, for example. So Sally also developed a counterbalancing positive belief that she was compe- tent in at least some ways. Sally\u2019s core beliefs about her world and about other people were, for the most part, positive and functional. She generally believed that other people were well-intentioned, and she perceived her world as being relatively safe, stable, and predictable. 42 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Again, Sally\u2019s core beliefs about herself, others, and her world were her most basic beliefs, which she had never really articulated until she entered treatment. As a teenager, her more positive core beliefs were dominant until she became depressed, and then her highly negative core beliefs became activated. Sally\u2019s Attitudes, Rules, and Assumptions Somewhat more amenable to modification than her core beliefs were Sally\u2019s intermediate beliefs. These attitudes, rules, and assumptions developed in the same way as core beliefs, as Sally tried to make sense of her world, of others, and of herself. Mostly through interactions with her family and significant others, she developed the following attitudes and rules: \u201cI should be great at everything I try.\u201d \u201cI should always do my best.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s terrible to waste your potential.\u201d As was the case with her core beliefs, Sally had not fully articulated these intermediate beliefs. But the beliefs nevertheless influenced her thinking and guided her behavior. In high school, for example, she did not try out for the school newspaper (although it interested her) because she assumed she could not write well enough. ",

But the beliefs nevertheless influenced her thinking and guided her behavior. In high school, for example, she did not try out for the school newspaper (although it interested her) because she assumed she could not write well enough. She felt both anxious before exams, thinking that she might not do well, and guilty, thinking that she should have studied more. When her more positive core beliefs predominated, however, she saw herself in a more positive light, although she never completely believed that she was competent. She developed the assumption \u201cIf I work hard, I can overcome my shortcomings and do well in school.\u201d When she became depressed, however, Sally did not really believe this assumption any longer and substituted the belief, \u201cBecause of my defi- ciencies, I\u2019ll never amount to anything.\u201d Sally\u2019s Coping Strategies The idea of being incompetent had always been quite painful to Sally, and she developed certain behavioral strategies to cope or compen- sate for what she saw as her shortcomings. As might be gleaned from her intermediate beliefs, Sally worked hard at school and at sports. She overprepared her assignments and studied quite hard for tests. She also became vigilant for signs of inadequacy and redoubled her efforts if she  Cognitive Conceptualization 43 failed to master something at school. She rarely asked others for help for fear they would recognize her inadequacy. Sally\u2019s Automatic Thoughts While Sally did not articulate these core beliefs and intermediate beliefs (until therapy), she was at least somewhat aware of her auto- matic thoughts in specific situations. In high school, for example (during which time she was not depressed), she tried out for the girls\u2019 softball and hockey teams. She made the softball team and thought, \u201cThat\u2019s great. I\u2019ll get Dad to practice batting with me.\u201d When she failed to make the hockey team she was disappointed, but not particularly self-critical. In college, however, Sally became depressed during her freshman year. Later, when she considered playing an informal softball game with students in her dorm, her depression influenced her thinking: \u201cI\u2019m no good. I probably \u00adwon\u2019t even be able to hit the ball.\u201d Similarly, when she got a C on an English literature examination, she thought, \u201cI\u2019m so stu- pid. I\u2019ll probably fail the course. I\u2019ll never be able to make it through college.\u201d To summarize, in her nondepressed high school years, Sally\u2019s more positive core beliefs were activated, and she had relatively more positive (and more realistic) thoughts.

In her freshman year in college, however, her negative beliefs predominated during her depression, which led her to interpret situations quite negatively and to have predominantly negative (and unrealistic) thoughts. These distorted thoughts also led her to behave in self-defeating ways, which led to automatic thoughts about her behavior. Instead of interpreting her avoidance as a symp- tom of depression, she thought, \u201cI\u2019m a basket case,\u201d which then led to increased dysphoria and maladaptive behavior. Sequence Leading to Sally\u2019s Depression How did Sally became depressed? Depression is caused by a variety of biopsychological and psychosocial factors. Sally may have had a genetic predisposition toward developing depressogenic beliefs. Not all nega- tive events, however, led her to feel dysphoric. She was able to get along until her innate vulnerability, influenced by the presence of negative beliefs, was challenged by a series of matching stressors (the \u201cdiathesis\u2013 stress\u201d model; Beck, 1967). When Sally began college, she had several experiences that she interpreted in a highly negative fashion. One such experience occurred the first week. She had a conversation with other freshmen in her dorm who were relating the number of advanced placement courses and 44 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND exams they had taken that had exempted them from several basic fresh- man courses. Sally, who had no advanced placement credits, began to think how superior these students were to her. In her economics class, her professor outlined the course requirements and Sally immediately thought, \u201cI \u00adwon\u2019t be able to do the research paper.\u201d She had difficulty understanding the first chapter in her chemistry text and she thought, \u201cIf I \u00adcan\u2019t even understand Chapter 1, how will I ever make it through the course?\u201d Sally\u2019s beliefs made her vulnerable to interpreting events in a nega- tive way. She did not question her thoughts, but rather accepted them uncritically. As the weeks went on, Sally began to have more and more negative thoughts about herself and began to feel more and more dis- couraged and sad. She began to spend an inordinate amount of time studying, although she did not accomplish a great deal because of decreased concentration. She continued to be highly self-critical, and even had negative thoughts about her depressive symptoms: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me? ",

I\u2019m just hopeless.\u201d She withdrew somewhat from new friends at school and stopped calling her old friends for support. She discontinued running and swimming and other activities that had previously provided her with a sense of accomplishment. Thus she experienced a paucity of positive inputs. Eventually, her appetite decreased, her sleep became disturbed, and she became enervated and listless. Sally\u2019s perception of and behavior in the circumstances at the time facilitated the expression of a biological and psychological vulnerability to depression. Conceptualizing a patient in cognitive terms is crucial to determin- ing the most efficient and effective course of treatment. It also aids in developing empathy, an ingredient that is critical in establishing a good working relationship with the patient. In general, the questions to ask when conceptualizing patients are: \u201cHow did the patient come to develop this disorder?\u201d \u201cWhat were significant life events, experiences, and interactions?\u201d \u201cWhat are the patient\u2019s most basic beliefs about himself, his world, and others?\u201d \u201cWhat are the patient\u2019s assumptions, expectations, rules, and attitudes (intermediate beliefs)?\u201d \u201cWhat strategies has the patient used throughout life to cope with these negative beliefs?\u201d \u201cWhich automatic thoughts, images, and behaviors help to maintain the disorder?\u201d  Cognitive Conceptualization 45 \u201cHow did the patient\u2019s developing beliefs interact with life situations to make the patient vulnerable to the disorder?\u201d \u201cWhat is happening in the patient\u2019s life right now and what are the patient\u2019s perceptions?\u201d Again, conceptualization begins at the first contact and is an ongo- ing process. You base your hypotheses on information you have col- lected from the patient, using the most parsimonious explanations and refraining from interpretations and inferences not clearly based on actual data. You will check out the conceptualization with patients at strategic points to ensure that it is accurate, as well as to help patients understand themselves and their difficulties. Your conceptualization is always subject to modification as you continually uncover new data that will lead you to confirm, refine, or discard your previous hypotheses. ",

Your conceptualization is always subject to modification as you continually uncover new data that will lead you to confirm, refine, or discard your previous hypotheses. The ongoing process of conceptualization is emphasized throughout this book; Chapter 14 illustrates further how historical events shape patients\u2019 understanding of themselves and their worlds.  46 Chapter 4 THE EVAlUATION SESSION I n this chapter, you will learn about the goals and structure for this session. You will learn how to conduct the assessment, relate your ten- tative diagnosis, develop initial treatment goals, and shape the patient\u2019s expectations for treatment. You will also learn what to do following the evaluation session, including devising a tentative cognitive conceptual- ization of the patient. Effective cognitive behavior therapy requires you to evaluate patients thoroughly, so you can accurately formulate the case, concep- tualize the individual patient, and plan treatment. While there is over- lap among treatments for various disorders, there are important varia- tions as well, based on the key cognitions and behavioral strategies of a particular disorder. Attention to the patient\u2019s presenting problems, current functioning, symptoms, and history helps you develop an ini- tial conceptualization and formulate a general therapy plan. Even if a patient has been evaluated by a different clinician, you will need to supplement the evaluation with additional data collection. There are a number of tasks to accomplish in your fi rst contact with a patient, other than establishing the patient\u2019s diagnosis. Assessment is not limited to this fi rst meeting with a patient, how- ever. You will continue to collect assessment data at each session to confi rm, change, or add to your diagnosis and conceptualization. It is possible to miss a diagnosis at intake if patients deliberately withhold information (some patients with substance abuse problems or ego-syn- tonic eating disorders may do this) or inadvertently fail to report impor- tant data. Or you might erroneously attribute certain symptoms (e.g.",

Or you might erroneously attribute certain symptoms (e.g.,  The Evaluation Session 47 social isolation) to a particular disorder (depression), when another disorder is also present (social phobia). When another clinician has performed the evaluation, you will undoubtedly need to collect addi- tional information pertinent to the use of cognitive behavior therapy as the treatment modality. Goals of the Assessment Session In addition to correctly diagnosing patients, the assessment helps you: Formulate the case and create an initial cognitive conceptualization \u2022 of the patient. Determine whether you will be an appropriate therapist. \u2022 Determine whether you can provide the appropriate \u201cdose\u201d of \u2022 therapy (e.g., if you are able to provide only weekly therapy but the patient requires a day program). Determine whether adjunctive treatment or services (such as \u2022 medication) may be indicated. Initiate a therapeutic alliance with the patient (and with family \u2022 members, if relevant). Begin to socialize the patient into the structure and process of \u2022 therapy. Identify important problems and set broad goals. \u2022 It is desirable to collect as much information as possible before you see the patient for the first time. Request that patients send, or arrange to have sent, relevant reports from current and previous clinicians, including both mental health and health professionals. The evaluation session itself will require less time if patients are able to fill out ques- tionnaires and self-report forms beforehand. It is especially important that patients have had a recent medical checkup. Occasionally patients suffer from organic problems, not psychological ones. For example, hypothyroidism can be mistaken for depression. Inform the patient during the initial phone call that it is often use- ful to have a family member, partner, or trusted friend accompany the patient to session to provide additional information and/or to learn how he or she can be helpful to the patient. Make sure patients under- stand that the evaluation will help you determine whether they are good candidates for cognitive behavior therapy and whether you believe you will be able to provide the needed treatment. 48 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Structure of the Assessment Session In this session, you will: Greet the patient. \u2022 Collaboratively decide with the patient whether a family \u2022 member should attend all, part, or none of the session. Set the agenda and convey appropriate expectations \u2022 for the session. Conduct the assessment. \u2022 Set initial broad goals. \u2022 Elicit feedback from the patient. ",

Set the agenda and convey appropriate expectations \u2022 for the session. Conduct the assessment. \u2022 Set initial broad goals. \u2022 Elicit feedback from the patient. \u2022 Starting the Evaluation Session Before patients enter your office, review whatever records they have brought and the forms they have completed. It is usually desirable to meet with patients alone at first. Then you can discuss whether an accompanying family member (if there is one) should attend the ses- sion. It is often helpful to bring this person in at least toward the end of the session, as you convey your initial impressions, including tentative diagnosis, and review broad therapy goals. You can ask for the family member\u2019s perspective on the patient\u2019s problems and, if advisable, set the scene for the family member to return at some point to learn what he or she can do to be more helpful to the patient. Next, let the patient know what to expect from this initial appoint- ment. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, as I explained on the phone, this is our evaluation session. It\u2019s not a therapy session, so we \u00adwon\u2019t work on solving your problems today. We\u2019ll start doing that next time. Today, I need to ask you a lot of questions [providing a rationale] so I can determine your diagnosis. Some of the questions will be relevant. A number \u00adwon\u2019t be, but I need to ask them so I can rule in the problems you do have and rule out the problems you \u00addon\u2019t have. Is that okay? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 I will probably need to interrupt you sometimes today, so I can get the information I need. If it bothers you, would you let me know?  The Evaluation Session 49 Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 Before we begin, I\u2019d like to tell you what I expect to cover today. [setting the agenda] I\u2019d like to find out a lot about symptoms \u00adyou\u2019ve been experiencing and how \u00adyou\u2019ve been functioning lately, and also about your history. Then I\u2019ll ask you to tell me anything else you think I should know. Then we\u2019ll set some broad goals for treatment. I\u2019ll tell you what my initial impressions are and what I think we should focus on in treatment. I\u2019ll ask you how that sounds. ",

I \u00addon\u2019t know whether there will be time today, but we can definitely get to it next time, at our first treatment session. The Assessment Phase You will need to know about many areas of the patient\u2019s current and past experience to develop a sound treatment plan (across sessions), plan treatment within sessions, develop a good therapeutic relation- ship, guide the patient in setting goals, and generally carry out effective treatment. These areas include: Patient demographics. \u2022 Chief complaints and current problems. \u2022 History of present illness and precipitating events. \u2022 Coping strategies (adaptive and maladaptive), current and \u2022 historical. Psychiatric history, including kinds of psychosocial treatments \u2022 (and perceived helpfulness of these treatments), hospitalizations, medication, suicide attempts, and current status. Substance use history and current status. \u2022 Medical history and current status. \u2022 Family psychiatric history and current status. \u2022 Developmental history. \u2022 50 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND General family history and current status. \u2022 Social history and current status. \u2022 Educational history and current status. \u2022 Vocational history and current status. \u2022 Religious/spiritual history and current status. \u2022 Strengths, values, and adaptive coping strategies. \u2022 While a detailed account of assessment procedures and instruments are beyond the scope of this book, many sources can help, including Ant- ony and Barlow (2010); Dobson and Dobson (2009); Kuyken and col- leagues (2009); Lazarus and Lazarus (1991); Ledley, Marx, and Heim- berg (2005). It is also critical to determine the degree to which patients might be suicidal. Wenzel, Brown, and Beck (2008) provide assessment and practice guidelines for suicidal patients. Another important part of the evaluation is asking how patients spend their time. Asking patients to describe their typical day gives you additional insight into their daily experience and facilitates setting spe- cific goals at the first treatment session. As they describe a typical day, look for: Variations in their mood. \u2022 Whether and how they interact with family, friends, \u2022 and people at work. How they are generally functioning at home, work, \u2022 and elsewhere. ",

Therapist:\u2002 Sally, I\u2019d like to get an idea of what your daily routine is like. Can you tell me what you do from the time you wake up in the morning until the time you go to sleep at night? Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 What time do you wake up? Patient:\u2002 (Sighs.) Well, I usually wake up around 5 o\u2019clock. Therapist:\u2002 Then what do you do?  The Evaluation Session 51 Patient:\u2002 Usually I toss and turn for a couple of hours at least. Therapist:\u2002 What time do you get out of bed for the day? Patient:\u2002 It depends. I usually stay in bed until the last minute. I have class at 9 o\u2019clock 3 days a week, so I get up at 8:30, 8:40, something like that. Therapist:\u2002 And on the other days? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t have to get up that early. So I usually stay in bed till I get hungry for breakfast. Therapist:\u2002 So you have breakfast at\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009? Patient:\u2002 Sometimes 10 o\u2019clock. Sometimes noon. Therapist:\u2002 Is that a change from last semester? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, I used to get up by 9 at the latest. Therapist:\u2002 What do you do after breakfast? Patient:\u2002 I usually hang out in my dorm room. Watch television. Maybe try to do some reading for class. But I usually \u00adcan\u2019t concentrate. So I stop doing it. Sometimes I fall asleep. Therapist:\u2002 What else do you do in the afternoon? Patient:\u2002 Most days I have class from 1 to 4. Therapist:\u2002 Do you go? Have you missed any classes? Patient:\u2002 No, I go. But it\u2019s really hard to sit there. Sometimes I just space out. Therapist:\u2002 What do you do after class? Patient:\u2002 Go back to my room. Therapist:\u2002 And then what? Patient:\u2002 It depends. Therapist:\u2002 What do you sometimes do? Patient:\u2002 Usually I try to study a little. But sometimes I end up surfing the Web or falling asleep or watching TV. Therapist:\u2002 What do you do for dinner? Patient:\u2002 I go to the cafeteria with someone from my dorm. Therapist:\u2002 What do you do after that? Patient:\u2002 It depends. Usually go back to my room. I try to do some work. Sometimes I can and sometimes I \u00adcan\u2019t. ",

Patient:\u2002 I get in bed around 11, 11:30. 52 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 Do you fall asleep right away? Patient:\u2002 Not usually. It takes me about an hour. Therapist:\u2002 And then you sleep through until 5? Patient:\u2002 Yes. This description helps me pinpoint difficulties we will probably need to address: difficulty sleeping, napping, irregular schedule, social isola- tion, limited opportunities for mastery (a sense of accomplishment), trouble concentrating, falling behind in schoolwork, too much TV watching. Because Sally, like most depressed patients, has focused on the problems she encounters, I also ask her about positive experiences and adaptive coping strategies. (\u201cSally, what are the better parts of the day for you?\u201d; \u201cIt sounds like you were pretty tired. How did you get yourself to go to class?\u201d) Collecting data in this way guides my thinking in developing an initial treatment plan. I\u2019ll also use the information in the first session when we set goals for treatment and do activity scheduling. In addition, I will ask Sally for a description of what she does on a typical weekend, when she \u00addoesn\u2019t have the structure of attending classes. Throughout the assessment phase, you will be alert for indications that the patient is unsure about committing to treatment. For example, as Sally describes her current symptoms, she expresses hopeless think- ing. I use her automatic thought to subtly relate the cognitive model, indicate how it will be a target of treatment in the future, and ensure that our tentative alliance \u00adhasn\u2019t suffered. Patient:\u2002 It feels like \u00adI\u2019ve got so many problems. I \u00addon\u2019t think anything can help. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, that\u2019s an interesting thought: \u201cI \u00addon\u2019t think anything can help.\u201d How does that thought make you feel? Sad? Hopeless? Patient:\u2002 Both. Therapist:\u2002 This is exactly the kind of depressed thought that we\u2019ll be talking about starting next week. We\u2019ll need to find out whether that thought is 100% true, 0% true, or someplace in the middle. Meanwhile, is there anything I said or did that makes you think I \u00adcan\u2019t help, or this kind of treatment \u00adcan\u2019t help?

The Evaluation Session 53 When patients start to provide unneeded details or go off on a tangent, it is important to gently interrupt: Therapist:\u2002 Sorry to interrupt, but I need to know\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Final Part of the Assessment Toward the end of the assessment, it is useful to ask patients whether there is anything else that is important for you to know. An important follow-up question is: \u201cIs there anything you\u2019re reluctant to tell me? You \u00addon\u2019t have to tell me what it is. I just need to know whether there\u2019s more to tell, maybe at some point in the future.\u201d Involving a Family Member If family members have accompanied patients to the office, you might now ask patients whether they would like to invite them into the session (unless, of course, they have been there from the beginning). Make sure there is nothing the patient wants you to refrain from saying to the family member. Elicit the patient\u2019s permission to: Inquire what the family member thinks is most important for \u2022 you to know; if he or she focuses only on the negative, ask about the patients\u2019 positive qualities, strengths, and coping strategies. Go over your initial impressions. \u2022 Present your tentative treatment plan. \u2022 Relating Your Impressions Explain to patients that you will need time to review your notes, their forms, and previous reports to establish their diagnosis. For most cases of depression and anxiety, it is appropriate to give your initial impres- sions of their diagnosis and show them how you will confirm the diagno- sis by using the DSM, a diagnostic manual listing psychiatric disorders and their symptoms. It may or may not help, at this initial encounter, to tell patients they have a severe mental illness or personality disorder. Instead, it may be more prudent to summarize the problems and symp- toms the patient is experiencing. 54 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Setting Initial Goals for Treatment and\u00a0Relating Your Treatment Plan Setting goals and relating a treatment plan help provide patients with hope. Therapist:\u2002 If it\u2019s okay, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes talking about your goals for treatment, and how I think treatment will go. Patient:\u2002 Okay. ",

Therapist:\u2002 (Writes \u201cGoals\u201d at the top of a sheet of paper.) Goals are really just the flip side of problems. We\u2019ll set more specific goals next ses- sion, but very broadly, should we say: Reduce depression? Reduce anxiety? Do better at school? Get back to socializing? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 (Jots these down.) Now I\u2019d like to tell you how I think you\u2019re going to get better and then I want to hear how it sounds to you. Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 Starting next week, we\u2019re going to work toward your goals. At every session, I\u2019ll ask you what problems you want my help in solving. For example, next week you might say, \u201cI\u2019m still having trouble getting my schoolwork done,\u201d which relates to your goal of doing better at school. Then we\u2019ll do some problem solving. We might figure out ways to improve your concentration, to get your- self on a study schedule, and to get help from other people if you need it. (pause) Does that sound okay? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 And we\u2019ll also look for depressed thinking that might get in the way. For example, earlier in the session you said, \u201cI\u2019m such a failure,\u201d and you told me how depressed you feel when you have thoughts like that. Do you see how that idea can sap your motiva- tion to study? How it can make you feel terrible? How you might then curl up in bed instead of going to the library? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, that\u2019s what happens. Therapist:\u2002 So one thing we\u2019ll do together is evaluate thoughts like that. What\u2019s the evidence you\u2019re a failure? Any evidence that you\u2019re not a failure? Is there another way of looking at this situation, for example, that you\u2019re depressed and need some help in problem solving, but that \u00addoesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a failure? Patient:\u2002 Hmm. Therapist:\u2002 So we\u2019ll help you change your depressed and anxious thinking to make it more realistic, and we\u2019ll come up with solu-  The Evaluation Session 55 tions to your problems that you can try out during the rest of the week.

[eliciting feedback] How does that sound? Patient:\u2002 It makes sense. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, that\u2019s how we find people get better, by making small changes in their thinking and behavior every day. [eliciting feed- back] Now, was there anything I said that \u00addidn\u2019t sound good? Patient:\u2002 [expressing another automatic thought] I just \u00addon\u2019t know if it will work. Therapist:\u2002 Well, I \u00addon\u2019t have a crystal ball, so I \u00adcan\u2019t give you a 100% guarantee. But there\u2019s nothing \u00adyou\u2019ve told me that makes me think it \u00adwon\u2019t work. (pause.) Are you willing to give it a try? Do you want to come back next week? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I do. Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients express concern about the treatment plan? A:\t First, positively reinforce them for expressing their skepticism or misgivings (\u201cIt\u2019s good you told me that\u201d). Next, you will need to collect more data by asking, \u201cWhat makes you think this treatment \u00adwon\u2019t work?\u201d and \u201cWhat do you think would help more?\u201d Based on the patient\u2019s answers, you will conceptualize the problem in cognitive terms and plan a strategy. For example, when patients believe your treatment \u00adwon\u2019t help because past treatments have been ineffective, you can ask whether they felt they had a good therapeutic alliance with their previous therapists and whether, at every session, their therapists: Set agendas. \u2022 Figured out with them what they could do to have a better \u2022 week. Wrote down what patients wanted to remember to say to them- \u2022 selves when they had depressed thinking. Taught them specifically how to evaluate their thinking and \u2022 change their behavior. Asked for feedback to make sure therapy was on the right \u2022 track. Most patients have not experienced this kind of treatment, and you can say, \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that, because it sounds as if our treatment here will be different. If it were exactly the same as your past experiences, I\u2019d be less hopeful.\u201d 56 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients reply that a previous therapist has engaged in all the above activities at every session?

A:\t In this case, you will need to spend more time finding out precisely what occurred, especially whether the therapist provided treat- ment individualized for the patient and his specific disorder(s), based on the latest research and practice guidelines. In any case, you can encourage the patient to give your treatment a try for a few sessions and indicate that you will then jointly review whether the treatment seems to be working. Expectations for Treatment At this session, you will give patients a general sense of how long they should expect treatment to take. Usually it is best to suggest a range, 2\u20134 months for many patients with straightforward major depression, although some might be able to terminate sooner (or might have to, due to financial constraints or insurance limitations). Other patients, par- ticularly those with chronic psychiatric disorders, or those who want to work on problems related to a personality disorder, may remain in treat- ment for a year or more. And patients with severe mental illness may need more intensive treatment when they are more highly symptomatic, and periodic booster sessions for a very long time (along with medication). Most patients progress satisfactorily with weekly sessions unless they are severely depressed or anxious, suicidal, or clearly in need of more support. Toward the end of treatment, you may gradually space sessions further apart to give patients more opportunities to solve prob- lems, make decisions, and use their therapy tools independently. In the following transcript, I give Sally an idea of how I expect therapy will proceed. Therapist:\u2002 If it\u2019s okay with you, Sally, we\u2019ll plan to meet once a week until you\u2019re feeling significantly better, then we\u2019ll move to once every 2 weeks, then maybe once every 3 or 4 weeks. We\u2019ll decide how to space out therapy together. Even when we decide to end, I\u2019ll recommend that you come back for a \u201cbooster\u201d session once every few months for a while. How does that sound? Patient:\u2002 Fine. Therapist:\u2002 It\u2019s hard to predict now how long you should be in therapy. My best guess is somewhere around 8 to 14 sessions. If we find that you have some long-standing problems that you want to work on, it could take longer. Again, we\u2019ll decide together what seems to be best. Okay?  ",

The Evaluation Session 57 Between the Evaluation and First Therapy Session Before the first therapy session, you will write up your evaluation report and initial treatment plan. If you have obtained consent, you will con- tact the patient\u2019s previous mental health and health professionals to request reports, ask questions, and obtain additional information. You will also contact relevant current professionals to discuss your findings and coordinate care. Conversations by phone can reveal important information that had not been documented in writing. You will also start to devise a tentative cognitive conceptualization. Devising an Initial Cognitive Conceptualization and\u00a0Treatment Plan You will synthesize the information you gleaned from the evaluation to develop an initial cognitive conceptualization, informed by the cogni- tive formulation (the basic beliefs and behavioral patterns) associated with the patient\u2019s diagnosis. You will hypothesize about the develop- ment of the patient\u2019s disorder. \u201cWere there important early life events that led to the development of negative core beliefs?\u201d \u201cWhat are the patient\u2019s core beliefs?\u201d \u201cWhat precipitated the disorder?\u201d \u201cDid the patient put an adverse construction on certain precipitating events?\u201d \u201cHow do the patient\u2019s thinking and behavior contribute to the maintenance of the disorder?\u201d You will then use the conceptualization to develop a broad treatment plan. Pulling together what I had learned from the evaluation, I hypoth- esized that Sally was vulnerable to seeing herself as incompetent (a belief that developed as a result of interactions with her parents, sibling, and some teachers). When she entered college, Sally began to perceive herself as unable to meet the new demands of school and independent living. She began to develop a generalized sense of incompetence; that is, a core belief of incompetence became activated. She began to have many automatic thoughts across situations about the likelihood that she would fail. These thoughts led her to feel sad, anxious, and hope- less. She was affected behaviorally, as well. She began to give up, spend- 58 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND ing too much time alone in her room. She failed to persist in doing assignments she viewed as difficult, and she began to fall behind in her schoolwork. She saw her difficulties as an innate flaw, and not as the result of depression. ",

She failed to persist in doing assignments she viewed as difficult, and she began to fall behind in her schoolwork. She saw her difficulties as an innate flaw, and not as the result of depression. A paucity of pleasure and mastery activities increased her dysphoria (see Appendix A). Understanding the cognitive model of depression and being famil- iar with the major treatment strategies for depression, I developed a more specific treatment plan than the simplified one I had presented to Sally. I hypothesized that I would initially need to focus on the fol- lowing: helping her solve academic and daily living problems; encour- aging her to become much more active; and teaching her to identify, evaluate, and modify her inaccurate or unhelpful negative thinking, especially thoughts associated with failure and incompetence (since she had expressed those ideas). I hypothesized that we would work more directly on her core belief of incompetence toward the middle of treatment, but I did not yet know whether it would be important to include a focus on the historic antecedents to her belief. I also did not know at this point whether Sally had dysfunctional beliefs associated with unlovability or worthlessness (see Chapter 14) that we would have to modify; she had not provided data to support the existence of these beliefs at the evaluation. I planned to emphasize relapse prevention in the final part of treatment. I continued to refine this basic treatment plan throughout therapy as I got to know Sally and the nature of her difficulties better.  59 Chapter 5 STRUCTURE Of THE fIRST THERAPY SESSION I n this chapter, you will learn how to structure the initial session, including how to: Discuss the patient\u2019s diagnosis. \u2022 Do a mood check. \u2022 Set goals. \u2022 Start working on a problem. \u2022 Set homework. \u2022 Elicit feedback. \u2022 Most patients feel comfortable when you tell them how and why you would like to structure sessions. Doing so demystifi es the process of therapy and keeps treatment on track. Chapter 6 focuses on an essen- tial component for depressed patients: initiating behavioral activation. Chapter 7 describes the common structure for subsequent sessions, and Chapter 8 discusses problems in structuring sessions. GOAlS AND STRUCTURE Of THE INITIAl SESSION Before the fi rst session, you will review the patient\u2019s intake evaluation and you will keep your initial conceptualization and treatment plan 60 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND in mind as you conduct the session, being prepared to change course if need be.

Most standard cognitive behavior therapy sessions last for about 45\u201350 minutes, but the first one often takes an hour. Your goals for the first session are to: Establish rapport and trust with patients, normalize their \u2022 difficulties, and instill hope. Socialize patients into treatment by educating them about their \u2022 disorder(s), the cognitive model, and the process of therapy. Collect additional data to help you conceptualize the patient. \u2022 Develop a goal list. \u2022 Start solving a problem important to the patient (and/or get the \u2022 patient behaviorally activated). To accomplish these goals, you will use the following format:  Initial Part of Session 1 1.\t Set the agenda (and provide a rationale for doing so). 2.\t Do a mood check. 3.\t Obtain an update (since the evaluation). 4.\t Discuss the patient\u2019s diagnosis and do psychoeducation. Middle Part of Session 1 5.\t Identify problems and set goals. 6.\t Educate the patient about the cognitive model. 7.\t Discuss a problem. End of Session 1 8.\t Provide or elicit a summary. 9.\t Review homework assignment. 10.\t Elicit feedback. Setting the Agenda As this is the first session, you will begin by greeting the patient and set- ting the agenda. Doing so frequently reduces patients\u2019 anxieties, as they quickly find out what to expect. You will provide a rationale and make sure the patient agrees with the topics you propose. (In future sessions,  Structure of the First Therapy Session 61 you will set the agenda sometime in the initial part of the session, but not necessarily at the very beginning.) Therapist:\u2002 Sally, I\u2019m glad you came in today. Is it all right if we start off by deciding what we\u2019re going to talk about today? It\u2019s what we call \u201csetting the agenda.\u201d We\u2019ll do this at the beginning of every ses- sion [providing a rationale] so we make sure we have time to cover what\u2019s most important to you.

First, in a couple of minutes [alerting Sally that I \u00addon\u2019t want to dive into a topic before setting a complete agenda], I\u2019d like to check on how \u00adyou\u2019ve been feeling, find out what\u2019s happened since the evaluation, and talk a little about your diagnosis. (pause) Then I\u2019d like to set some more specific goals. Does that sound okay? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 Along the way, we might figure out some things for you to do before we meet again, [behavioral activation] especially making some changes in your schedule. And at the end, I\u2019ll ask you what you thought about the session. [eliciting feedback] How does that sound? Patient:\u2002 Fine. Therapist:\u2002 Is there anything you want to add to the agenda today? Patient:\u2002 Well, I know I should be doing more. But I\u2019m so tired. It\u2019s just so hard to concentrate on my work and go out with friends. I end up spending a lot of time sleeping or watching TV and\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Therapist:\u2002 (gently interrupting) Is it okay if I interrupt you for a moment? How about if I put \u201cdoing more things\u201d on our agenda, and we\u2019ll try to get to it today? Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 (jotting down this agenda item) You\u2019ll notice that I tend to write down a lot of things during our session. [providing a ratio- nale] I want to make sure to remember what\u2019s important\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Okay, anything else even more important for the agenda today? Patient:\u2002 No, I \u00addon\u2019t think so. Therapist:\u2002 If you think of other important things as we go along, just let me know. 62 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Ideally, setting the agenda is quick and to the point. Explaining the rationale for why you want to set an agenda makes the process of ther- apy more understandable to patients and elicits their active participa- tion in a structured, productive way. Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients express a strong preference to spend therapy time in another way? A:\t Patients occasionally, though infrequently, balk at the agenda you present for this first session. This might happen for several rea- sons. You may have presented the agenda in too controlling a fashion, without being collaborative. There may be pressing issues on their mind for which they desperately want immediate help in the session.

You may have presented the agenda in too controlling a fashion, without being collaborative. There may be pressing issues on their mind for which they desperately want immediate help in the session. They might prefer to spend the session talking freely about whatever comes in their mind, without structure or inter- ruption. What do you do? Above all, you need to engage patients so they will return to treatment for the next session. If you judge that trying to persuade patients to adhere to your agenda will endan- ger their engagement, especially in this first session, you might offer to split the therapy time. If they demur, you can spend the session doing what they want. At the next session, you will find out whether doing so helped alleviate their suffering significantly during the week. If not, they may be more motivated to spend at least part of the session discussing what you think is important to help them feel better. Doing a Mood Check Having set the agenda, you will next do a brief mood check. In addition to asking Sally for a brief narrative report of her mood since I saw her last, I quickly review the symptom checklists she filled out just prior to the session (see Appendix B for information about the Beck Depres- sion Inventory, Anxiety Inventory, and Hopelessness Scale). Because I initially just want a brief overview of her mood, I cue her to provide me with an answer in just a few words. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, next. Can we start with how \u00adyou\u2019ve been doing this week? I\u2019d like to see the forms you filled out. While I look them over, [providing a guideline] can you tell me in a sentence or two how you felt for most of the week? \u00adPatient:\u2002 I\u2019ve been really depressed the whole time.  Structure of the First Therapy Session 63 Therapist:\u2002 (looking over the forms) It looks as if \u00adyou\u2019ve been feeling pretty anxious, too, is that right? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 [being collaborative] If it\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019d like you to come to every session a few minutes early so you can fill out these three forms. [providing a rationale] They help give me a quick idea of how \u00adyou\u2019ve been feeling in the past week, although I\u2019ll always want you to describe how \u00adyou\u2019ve been doing in your own words, too. Patient:\u2002 Okay. In this first session, as in every session, I note the summed scores of the objective tests, comparing them to the scores from the evaluation. ",

Patient:\u2002 Okay. In this first session, as in every session, I note the summed scores of the objective tests, comparing them to the scores from the evaluation. I also quickly scan individual items to determine whether the tests point out anything of particular importance. I especially note items related to hopelessness and suicidality on the Beck Depression Inventory\u2013II. If these items are elevated, I will do a risk assessment (Wenzel et al., 2008) to determine whether we need to spend the next part of the session developing a plan to keep the patient safe. Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients cannot or will not fill out objective tests? A:\t If you do not have access to symptom checklists, if they are inap- propriate for patients (e.g., patients \u00adaren\u2019t sufficiently literate), or if they express reluctance about completing them, you can teach them, at this initial session or at the next session, to rate their mood on a 0\u201310 scale: \u201cCan you think back over the past week? If 0 means not depressed at all, and 10 means the most depressed \u00adyou\u2019ve ever been, what has your depression been like for most of the week?\u201d Or you can ask patients, \u201cCan you tell me about your depression this week? Would you say it was mild, moderate, or severe? How did your mood compare to other weeks?\u201d Other problems related to doing a mood check are discussed in Chap- ter\u00a08. Obtaining an Update In the next part of the session, you will question patients to discover whether there are any important problems or issues that they have not yet mentioned that might take priority in the session. Then you will probe for positive experiences the patient had during the week. 64 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 Next, what happened between the evaluation and now that\u2019s important for me to know? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks.) Well, my parents have been putting pressure on me to figure out what I\u2019m going to do this summer. Therapist:\u2002 [collecting data about the problem to establish whether it\u2019s of immediate importance and of high priority] Has this been really upsetting to you? Patient:\u2002 (Sighs.) Not that much. It\u2019s just one more thing. Therapist:\u2002 Is this something you want my help with? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I guess so. Therapist:\u2002 We \u00addon\u2019t have a lot of time today. Do you think we could postpone talking about it until another time? Patient:\u2002 That\u2019s okay. ",

Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019ll put it at the bottom of my notes, and ask you next week how high a priority it is for you. Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 Was there anything else that was really important this week? Patient:\u2002 No, I guess not. It was pretty much the same as last week. By asking these questions, I find out that there is not an important problem that needs to take priority over what is already on the agenda, so I can move ahead. How do you decide which problems are pressing and which are not? You will establish how distressed the patient is by the problem and whether the patient really needs to solve it immediately (e.g., not solv- ing it could put the patient or others in harm\u2019s way, or endanger the patient\u2019s livelihood or living situation). Discussion of most problems, especially chronic ones (such as difficulty functioning at home or argu- ments with family members), can usually be postponed to a future ses- sion so you can cover what you need to in this initial session. Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. there had been a pressing agenda item? A:\t There are several reasons for deviating from the usual structure in the first session. 1.\t If patients are at risk or they are putting others at risk. 2.\t If patients are so distressed by a problem that they cannot focus on the topics that you want to cover. 3.\t If you assess that patients will be so upset by not discuss-  Structure of the First Therapy Session 65 ing the problem that the therapeutic relationship could be impaired, and/or that the patient is likely not to come back for another session.

You then ask, \u201cWhat positive things happened this week?\u201d or \u201cWhen were some times that you felt even a little bit better this week?\u201d These questions help patients see real- ity more clearly, as the depression has undoubtedly led them to focus almost exclusively on the negative.

Discussing the Diagnosis In the next part of the session, you will briefly review patients\u2019 present- ing problems and ask them to bring you up to date: Therapist:\u2002 Sally, I\u2019d like to discuss what I found out in the evaluation session last week. Is it okay if we talk for a few moments about your diagnosis? Most patients want to know their general diagnosis, and to establish that you \u00addon\u2019t think they are strange or abnormal. Usually it is prefer- able to avoid the label of a personality disorder diagnosis. Instead it is better to say something more general and jargon free, such as, \u201cIt looks as if \u00adyou\u2019ve been pretty depressed for the last year and \u00adyou\u2019ve had some long-standing problems with relationships and with work.\u201d It\u2019s also desirable to give patients some initial information about their condition so they can start attributing some of their problems to their disorder instead of to their character (\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with me. I\u2019m just no good.\u201d) The following transcript illustrates how to edu- cate patients who are depressed. Therapist:\u2002 The evaluation shows that you have a moderate depres- sion. I want you to know that it\u2019s a real illness. It\u2019s not the same as people saying, \u201cOh, I\u2019m so depressed\u201d when they\u2019re feeling down. You have a real depression. Patient:\u2002 (Sighs.) Therapist:\u2002 I know that because you have the symptoms in this diag- nostic manual (showing Sally the DSM). For each mental health dis- order, this manual lists the symptoms, just as a neurology diagnos- tic manual would list the symptoms of a migraine. 66 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Patient:\u2002 Oh, I \u00addidn\u2019t know that. Therapist:\u2002 [providing hope] Fortunately, cognitive behavior therapy is very effective in helping people overcome depression. Patient:\u2002 I was afraid you\u2019d think I was crazy. Therapist:\u2002 Not at all. [normalizing] You have a fairly common condi- tion, and it sounds as though you have a lot of the same problems as most of our patients here. But that\u2019s typical of how people with depression think. How do you feel now that \u00adyou\u2019ve found out I \u00addon\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy? Patient:\u2002 (Sighs.) Relieved.

Therapist:\u2002 [anticipating that Sally might blame herself for thinking in an unrealistic way] Now, it\u2019s not your fault that you have this kind of negative thinking. It\u2019s a primary symptom of depression. For every- one with depression, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re seeing themselves and their worlds and the future [the \u201ccognitive triad\u201d of depression] through eyeglasses covered with black paint. (I pantomime painting an imagi- nary pair of glasses on my face.) These dark glasses make everything look dark and hopeless. Part of what we\u2019ll do in therapy is to scrape off the black paint (pantomiming) so you can see things more real- istically\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Is that clear? [Using an analogy often helps the patient to see her situation in a different way.] Patient:\u2002 Yeah. I understand. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, let\u2019s go over some of the other symptoms of depres- sion that you have. I see from the evaluation that the depression is interfering with your sleep and your energy. It sounds as if it\u2019s also affecting your motivation to do things. [normalizing] Now, most depressed people start criticizing themselves for not being the same as they had been before. [eliciting specific incidents] Do you remember any recent times \u00adyou\u2019ve criticized yourself? Patient:\u2002 (Sighs.) Yeah. Lately \u00adI\u2019ve been getting out of bed late and not getting my work done, and I think I\u2019m lazy and no good. Therapist:\u2002 Now, if you had pneumonia, and had trouble getting out of bed and getting everything done, would you call yourself lazy and no good? Patient:\u2002 No, I guess not. Therapist:\u2002 Would it help this week if you answered back the thought, \u201cI\u2019m lazy and no good\u201d?  Structure of the First Therapy Session 67 Patient:\u2002 Probably. Therapist:\u2002 What could you remind yourself? [Eliciting a response rather than just providing one fosters active participation and a degree of autonomy.] Patient:\u2002 I guess that I am depressed, and it\u2019s harder for me to do things.

Remind myself that just because I think something, \u00addoesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s true. 4.\t Make plans with Allison and Joe.

A:\t Some patients say, \u201cYes, but pneumonia is a biological disease.\u201d A good reply to this includes the specific depressive symptoms the patient has been experiencing: \u201cDepression is biological, too; it\u2019s a real disease with real symptoms. Now, just feeling sad or down is not an illness.

Therapist:\u2002 Now, let\u2019s review the problems \u00adyou\u2019ve been having. Patient:\u2002 (Sighs.) Oh, I \u00addon\u2019t know. Everything is such a mess. I\u2019m doing terribly at school. I\u2019m way behind. I feel so tired and down all the time. I feel sometimes like I should just give up.

I just wish all my problems would somehow go away. Therapist:\u2002 (empathically) It sounds like you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I \u00addon\u2019t know what to do. Therapist:\u2002 [helping Sally to focus and to break down her problems into a more manageable size] Okay, it sounds like you have two major problems right now. One is that you\u2019re not doing well at school. The other is that you feel really tired and down. Are there any others?  Structure of the First Therapy Session 69 Patient:\u2002 Well, like I told you last week, I know I\u2019m alone in my room too much. I should be spending more time with my friends. Therapist:\u2002 [getting Sally to participate more actively in the goal-set- ting process] Okay, let\u2019s turn these problems into goals. Would you like to write them down, or should I? Patient:\u2002 You can. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. (writing as they go along) Now, the first thing you mentioned was improving your schoolwork. Then you mentioned decreasing your worry about tests and grades and spending more time with friends. Good. Now what other goals do you have? How would you like to be different? Or how would you like your life to be different as a result of treatment? Patient:\u2002 (pausing) I\u2019d like to be happier. Therapist:\u2002 [reinforcing the patient] That\u2019s a good goal. This goal, however, is too broad. It\u2019s difficult to figure out how to help the patient become happier, so I ask Sally to specify in behavioral terms what being \u201chappier\u201d means to her.

I also guided Sally in specifying a general goal (\u201cI\u2019d like to be happier\u201d) in behavioral terms. Rather than allowing a discussion of goals to dominate the session, I ask Sally to refine the list for homework. Finally, I summarized what we had discussed to that point. Doing so helps make the process of therapy more understandable and keeps us on track. Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. a patient sets goals for someone else? A:\t Occasionally patients state a goal over which they do not have direct control: \u201cI\u2019d like my partner to be nicer to me\u201d; \u201cI want my boss to stop putting so much pressure on me\u201d; \u201cI want my kids to listen to me.\u201d In this case, it is important to help them phrase the goal so that it is something they do have control over: Therapist:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t want to promise you that we can directly get Joe to be nicer to you. What do you think of phrasing it this way: \u201cLearn new ways of talking to Joe.\u201d Maybe if you take control and change what you\u2019re doing, it will have some impact on Joe.  For a fuller discussion of what to do when patients set goals for others, see J. S. Beck (2005). ",

Educating the Patient about\u00a0the\u00a0Cognitive\u00a0Model An important feature of the initial session is helping patients under- stand how their thinking affects their reactions, preferably using their own examples. You can take advantage of patients\u2019 spontaneous utter- ances in session (e.g., \u201cI \u00adcan\u2019t do anything right. Nothing can help. I\u2019ll never feel better\u201d). Or you can ask them, \u201cWhat\u2019s going through your mind right now?\u201d when you notice a shift in affect. It is probably easier, though, for the novice therapist to devote a portion of the first session providing psychoeducation about the relationship among triggering situations, automatic thoughts or images, and reactions (emotional, behavioral, and physiological). Therapist:\u2002 Can we talk for a few minutes about how your thinking affects your mood? Can you think of any time in the past few days when you noticed your mood change? When you were aware that you had become particularly upset? Patient:\u2002 I think so.  Structure of the First Therapy Session 71 Therapist:\u2002 Can you tell me a little about it? Patient:\u2002 I was having lunch with a couple of people from my Eng- lish class, and I started to feel really bad. They were talking about something the professor had said in class that I \u00addidn\u2019t really under- stand. Therapist:\u2002 Do you remember what you were thinking? Patient:\u2002 Ummm, that they\u2019re much smarter than I am. That I\u2019ll prob- ably flunk the course. Therapist:\u2002 (using Sally\u2019s precise words) So you had the thoughts \u201cThey\u2019re much smarter than I am. I\u2019ll probably flunk the course,\u201d and how did those thoughts make you feel emotionally? Happy, sad, wor- ried, angry.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009? Patient:\u2002 Oh, sad, really sad. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, how about if we make a diagram? You just gave a good example of how, in a specific situation, your thoughts influ- ence your emotion. (Composes the diagram below and reviews it with Sally.) Is it clear to you? That how you viewed this situation led to automatic thoughts that then then influenced how you felt? Patient:\u2002 I think so. Situation: At lunch with classmates \uf090 Automatic thoughts: \u201cThey\u2019re much smarter than I am. ",

Is there another time when you were feeling particu- larly upset? Patient:\u2002 Well, just a few minutes ago, when I was waiting in the waiting room. I was feeling really down. Therapist:\u2002 And what was going through your mind at the time? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t remember exactly. Therapist:\u2002 [trying to make the experience more vivid in Sally\u2019s mind] Can you imagine yourself back in the waiting room right now? Can you imagine sitting there? Describe the scene for me as if it\u2019s hap- pening right now. Patient:\u2002 Well, I\u2019m sitting in the chair near the door, away from the 72 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND receptionist. A woman comes in, she\u2019s smiling and talking to the receptionist. She looks kind of happy and\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. normal. Therapist:\u2002 And how are you feeling as you look at her? Patient:\u2002 Kind of sad. Therapist:\u2002 What\u2019s going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 She\u2019s not like me. She\u2019s happy. I\u2019ll never be like that again. Therapist:\u2002 [reinforcing the cognitive model] Okay. That\u2019s another good example. The situation was that you saw a happy-looking woman in the reception area and you thought, \u201cI\u2019ll never be like that again\u201d\u2014and that thought made you feel sad. Is this clear to you? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. I think so. Therapist:\u2002 [making sure Sally can verbalize her understanding of the cognitive model] Can you tell me in your own words about the con- nection between thoughts and feelings? Patient:\u2002 Well, it seems that my thoughts affect how I feel. Therapist:\u2002 Yes, that\u2019s right. [facilitating Sally\u2019s carrying through the work of the therapy session throughout the week] What I\u2019d like you to do, if you agree, is to keep track this coming week of what\u2019s going through your mind when you notice your mood changing or getting worse. Okay? Patient:\u2002 Uh-huh. Therapist:\u2002 In fact, how about if I write it down on the Homework List: When I notice my mood getting worse, ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s going through my mind?\u201d and jot down the thoughts. When you come in next week, we can evaluate your thoughts to see whether they\u2019re 100% true, or 0% true, or someplace in the middle. Okay? Patient:\u2002 Yes. ",

Therapist:\u2002 Lots of times, because you\u2019re depressed, I think you\u2019ll find that these thoughts \u00adaren\u2019t completely accurate. I\u2019ll write something down about that, too: Just because I think something \u00addoesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s true. When we find out your thoughts \u00adaren\u2019t true, or not completely true, I\u2019ll teach you how to look at the situation in a more realistic way. When you do that, I think you\u2019ll find that you feel bet- ter. For example, we might find that your classmates \u00adaren\u2019t much smarter than you, and that the reason you\u2019re struggling has noth- ing to do with your intelligence, but has everything to do with the fact that you\u2019re depressed. And we might then do some problem solving to help you with the course. For example, you might ask for help from a friend or a teaching assistant or a tutor.  Structure of the First Therapy Session 73 Patient:\u2002 That sounds hard. Therapist:\u2002 That\u2019s another good example of an automatic thought: \u201cThat sounds hard.\u201d Well, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. We\u2019ll be working as a team, together, to help you solve your problems, and we\u2019ll go step by step. (pause) Can you see how changing your thinking and doing some problem solving might help improve your mood? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 (Using an encouraging tone of voice.) And I think you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get good at it pretty soon. Meanwhile, can you try to write down other depressed thoughts like that so we can look at them next session? Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 [checking to see whether Sally anticipates difficulties that might require advance problem solving] Do you think you\u2019ll have any trouble doing that? Patient:\u2002 No. I think I\u2019ll be able to. Therapist:\u2002 Good. But even if you \u00adcan\u2019t, that\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll come back next week and we\u2019ll work on it together. Patient:\u2002 Okay. In this section, I explain, illustrate, and record the cognitive model with the patient\u2019s own examples. I try to limit my explanations to just a couple of sentences at a time; depressed patients, in particular, have difficulty concentrating. I also ask Sally to put what \u00adI\u2019ve said in her own words so I can check on her understanding. ",

Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients have difficulty grasping the cognitive model in the first session? A:\t You will decide whether to try other techniques (see Chapter 9), or whether to return to this task in the next session. Common sense dictates that you not push too hard, which could lead patients to have negative thoughts about their competence or about you. If you decide against further explication of the cognitive model at this point, take care to downplay the importance of the skill to reduce the probability that patients will blame themselves. (\u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard to figure out these thoughts. Usually they\u2019re so quick. It\u2019s no big deal, though. We\u2019ll come back to it another time.\u201d) 74 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Discussion of Problem or\u00a0Behavioral\u00a0Activation If there is time in this first session, you will start discussing a specific problem of significant concern to the patient. Developing alternate ways of viewing the problem, or concrete steps patients can take to solve the problem, tends to increase their hopefulness that treatment will be effec- tive. Unless patients express a problem of overriding importance, try to elicit their agreement to discuss the problem of inactivity\u2014that is, if they have withdrawn from activities or are generally at least somewhat inac- tive. Overcoming depressive passivity and creating opportunities to expe- rience pleasure and a sense of mastery is essential for most depressed patients. Behavioral activation is discussed in the next chapter. End-of-Session Summary and Setting of\u00a0Homework The final summary ties together the threads of the session and rein- forces important points. The summary also includes a review of what the patient has agreed to do for homework. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, our time is almost up. Can you tell me what you think is most important for you to remember this week? You can look at your notes [page 67]. Patient:\u2002 Well, I guess that I\u2019m not lazy. And I might have a lot of depressed thoughts that will make me feel bad, even if they\u2019re not true. Therapist:\u2002 Right. ",

And how about the idea that getting more active might help improve your mood? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 Can we go over the homework now? I want to make sure it\u2019s doable. (pointing to the paper) The first thing we wrote down is to remind yourself that you\u2019re depressed, so you \u00adwon\u2019t start thinking that you\u2019re no good. Now, how will you remember to do that? Do you think you could read this sheet of paper when you get up every morning? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 How long do you think it will take you? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. Maybe 5 minutes? Therapist:\u2002 Actually, I think it will take less than a minute. Patient:\u2002 Yeah, that\u2019s probably right.  Structure of the First Therapy Session 75 Therapist:\u2002 How will you remember to do it? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks.) I\u2019m not sure. I \u00addon\u2019t want to keep it out because my roommate could see it. Therapist:\u2002 [making specific suggestions] Could you keep the paper somewhere else, like in your backpack? Maybe you could set an alarm on your cell phone, so when it beeps, you\u2019ll remember to get it out and read it? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, that would work. Therapist:\u2002 It would also be good to read it at least once more every day. When do you think it would help most? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks.) Probably right after dinner. Therapist:\u2002 That sounds good. Do you want to set an alarm for then, also? Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019ll write that plan at the top of the sheet. Next, we add to the homework assignment sheet, noting aloud how long each task will probably take to accomplish. Many patients overesti- mate the difficulty and duration of tasks. Specifying time requirements help ease the perceived burden. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, we also talked earlier in the session about adding to your goal list this week. Do you think you could spend a minute or two on it this week? Patient:\u2002 Sure. Therapist:\u2002 And finally, I have a booklet here about depression [Coping with Depression; see Appendix B]. Should we make it optional? Patient:\u2002 (Nods.) Therapist:\u2002 I think it will take about 5 or 10 minutes to read. If you do read it, you can make mental notes or written notes on what you agree with and what you \u00addon\u2019t. Patient:\u2002 Okay. ",

In this part of the session, I want to maximize the chance that Sally will do the homework and feel successful. If you sense that the patient may not carry out any part of the assignment, you may offer to change it (\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll have trouble jotting down your thoughts?\u201d [If yes] \u201cDo you think we should make it optional?\u201d). Depressed patients can easily become overwhelmed and then self-critical if they do not com- plete their homework assignments. (See Chapter 17 for an extended discussion of homework.) 76 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND We also discussed when it would be helpful for Sally to read this sheet of paper. It is important to note that Sally, accustomed to doing homework for school, is less likely to be overwhelmed and more likely to follow through with these activities than another depressed patient might be. Some patients may decide to transfer this written list to their smartphone or other electronic device. Feedback The final element of every therapy session, at least initially, is feed- back. By the end of the first session, most patients feel positively about the therapist and the therapy. Eliciting feedback further strengthens rapport, providing the message that you care about what the patient thinks. It also gives patients a chance to express, and you to resolve, any misunderstandings. Patients may occasionally make an idiosyncratic interpretation of something you said or did. Asking them whether there was anything that bothered them gives them the opportunity to state and then to test their conclusions. In addition to verbal feedback, you may decide to have patients complete a written Therapy Report (see Figure 5.2). Therapist:\u2002 Now at the end of each session, I\u2019m going to ask how you thought the session went. You actually get two chances\u2014telling me directly or writing it on a Therapy Report, which you can fill out in the waiting room after our session. I\u2019ll read it over, and if there are any problems, we can put them on the agenda at our next session. Okay? Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 Now, what did you think of today\u2019s session? Was there any- thing about this session that bothered you or anything you thought I got wrong? Patient:\u2002 No, it was good. Therapist:\u2002 Anything you\u2019d like us to do differently next session? Patient:\u2002 No, I \u00addon\u2019t think so. Therapist:\u2002 Okay then. ",

A:\t You will try to specify the problem and establish its meaning to the patient, then intervene or mark the problem for intervention at the next session, as in the following example: Therapist: Now, was there anything about this session that both- ered you? Patient: I \u00addon\u2019t know\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019m not sure this therapy is for me. Therapist: You \u00addon\u2019t think it\u2019ll help? Patient: No, not really. You see, \u00adI\u2019ve got real-life problems. It\u2019s not just my thinking. Therapist: I\u2019m glad you told me. This gives me the opportunity to say that I do believe that you have real-life problems. I \u00addidn\u2019t mean to imply that you \u00addon\u2019t. The problems with your boss and your neighbors and your feelings of loneliness\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Of course, those are all real problems; problems we\u2019ll work together to solve. I \u00addon\u2019t think that all we need to do is look at your thoughts. I\u2019m sorry if I gave you that impression. Patient: That\u2019s okay\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. It\u2019s just, like\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. well, I feel so overwhelmed. ",

We could make the homework optional, or some of it optional, if you want. Patient: (sigh of relief) Yeah, that would be better. Therapist: What seems hardest to do? Patient: Trying to keep track of my thoughts. Therapist: Okay, let\u2019s write \u201coptional\u201d next to that one. Or should I just cross it off?

Now, was there anything else that bothered you about today\u2019s session? Here the therapist recognizes the necessity for strengthening the therapeutic alliance. The therapist had either missed signs of the patient\u2019s dissatisfaction during the session or the patient was adept at concealing it. Had the therapist failed to ask for feedback about the session or been less adept at dealing with the negative feedback, it is possible that the patient would not have returned for another session. The therapist\u2019s flexibility about the homework assignment helps the patient reexamine his misgivings about the appropriateness of cognitive behavior therapy. By responding to feedback and making reasonable adjustments, the therapist demonstrates understanding of and empathy toward the patient, which facilitates collaboration and trust. The therapist will make sure to express at the beginning of the next session how important it is that they work as a team to tailor the treatment and the homework so the patient finds them helpful. The therapist also uses this difficulty as an opportunity to refine the conceptualization of the patient. In the future, the therapist ensures that homework is set more collaboratively with the patient and that he does not feel overwhelmed. The initial therapy session has several important goals: establish- ing rapport; refining the conceptualization; socializing patients to the process and structure of cognitive behavior therapy; educating patients about the cognitive model and about their disorder(s); and providing hope and some symptom relief.

Developing a solid therapeutic alliance and encouraging patients to join with you to accomplish therapeutic goals are of primary importance in this session. Chapter 7 describes the structure of subsequent therapy sessions and Chapter 8 deals with difficulties in structuring sessions.  80 Chapter 6 BEHAVIORAl ACTIVATION O ne of the most important initial goals for depressed patients is scheduling activities. Most have withdrawn from at least some activities that had previously given them a sense of achievement or pleasure and lifted their mood. And they frequently have increased certain behaviors (staying in bed, watching television, sitting around) that maintain or increase their current dysphoria. They often believe that they cannot change how they feel emotionally. Helping them to become more active and to give themselves credit for their efforts are essential parts of treatment, not only to improve their mood, but also to strengthen their sense of self-effi cacy by demonstrating to themselves that they can take more control of their mood than they had previously believed. CONCEPTUAlIzATION Of INACTIVITY When considering engaging in activities, patients\u2019 depressed automatic thoughts frequently get in their way. Situation: Thinking about initiating an activity \uf090 [Common] Automatic thoughts: \u201cI\u2019m too tired. I  won\u2019t enjoy it. My friends  won\u2019t want to spend time with me. I  won\u2019t be able to do it. Nothing can help me feel better.\u201d  Behavioral Activation 81 \uf090 [Common] Emotional reactions: Sadness, anxiety, hopelessness \uf090 [Common] Behavior: Remain inactive. Patients\u2019 relative inactivity then contributes to their low mood, as they have a paucity of opportunities to gain a sense of mastery or plea- sure, which leads to more negative thinking, which leads to increased dysphoria and inactivity, in a vicious cycle. Conceptualization of Lack of Mastery or\u00a0Pleasure Even when patients do engage in various activities, they often derive low levels of satisfaction and pleasure because of their self-critical auto- matic thoughts. Situation: Engaging in an activity \uf090 [Common] Automatic thoughts: \u201cI\u2019m doing a terrible job. I should have done this long ago. There\u2019s still so much left to do. I \u00adcan\u2019t do this as well as I used to. This used to be more fun. I \u00addon\u2019t deserve to be doing this.\u201d \uf090 [Common] Emotional reactions: Sadness, guilt, anger at self \uf090 [Common] Behaviors: Stop the activity. Push self beyond a reasonable point. ",

When scheduling activities, it\u00a0 is\u00a0 important to anticipate automatic thoughts that could interfere with patients\u2019 initiation of activities, as well as thoughts that could diminish patients\u2019 sense of pleasure or achievement during or after an activity. When you are treating relatively \u201ceasy\u201d patients like Sally, you will facilitate the identification of activities that could potentially help them feel better, address interfering thoughts, and assist them in putting pleasurable or productive activities in their schedule. You may need to help more severely depressed patients develop an hourly schedule of 82 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND activities for the week to counteract their extensive passivity and inactiv- ity. It may also be useful for some patients to rate their sense of pleasure and achievement following their activities, to examine whether becom- ing more active and responding to their dysfunctional thinking does improve their mood. Perhaps the easiest and quickest way to get patients behaviorally activated is to review their typical daily schedule (pages 50\u201352). The following questions can guide your discussion. Which activities are patients doing too little of, thus depriving \u2022 themselves of obtaining a sense of achievement (mastery), a sense of pleasure, or both? These might be activities related to work or school, family, friends, their neighborhood, volunteering, sports, hobbies, physical exercise, their household, nature, spirituality, or sensual, intellectual, or cultural pursuits. Do patients have a good balance of mastery and pleasure \u2022 experiences? For example, are patients driving themselves too hard, and so have a dearth of pleasure? Are they avoiding activities they predict will be challenging, and so have little opportunity to obtain a sense of mastery? Which activities are lowest in mastery and/or pleasure? Are these \u2022 activities inherently dysphoric, such as ruminating in bed, and so should their frequency be reduced? Or are patients feeling dysphoric during potentially rewarding activities because of their depressed thinking? ",

In the following transcripts, I review Sally\u2019s schedule with her, reinforce her conclusions about how she might better plan her time, encourage her to commit to specific changes, elicit the thoughts that might impede instituting the changes, label her thoughts as predictions that can be tested, give her the choice of a follow-up homework assign- ment, and teach her to give herself credit. Therapist:\u2002 Thinking about your schedule, what do you notice? How are your activities different from say, a year ago, when you \u00adweren\u2019t depressed? Patient:\u2002 Well, I\u2019m spending a lot of time in bed. Therapist:\u2002 Does staying in bed make you feel much better? Do you get out of bed feeling refreshed and energetic? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks.) No\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I guess not. I usually feel groggy and down when I get up.  Behavioral Activation 83 Therapist:\u2002 Well, that\u2019s valuable information. [providing psychoedu- cation] It seems most people who are depressed think they\u2019ll feel better if they stay in bed. But they usually find that doing almost anything else is better\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. What else is different? Patient:\u2002 Last semester, I used to go out more with friends or just hang around with them. Now I just go from my dorm room, to class, to the library, to the cafeteria, and back to my room. Therapist:\u2002 Does that give you an idea of what you might like to change this coming week? Patient:\u2002 Yes, well, I\u2019d like to spend more time with other people, but I just \u00addon\u2019t seem to have any energy. Therapist:\u2002 So you end up staying in bed? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 Well, that\u2019s an interesting idea you have: \u201cI \u00addon\u2019t have the energy to spend time with people.\u201d Let\u2019s write that down. [inquir- ing about setting up a behavioral experiment] Now, how could we test this idea to see if it\u2019s true? Patient:\u2002 I guess I could plan to spend some time with my friends and see if I could do it. Therapist:\u2002 [trying to motivate Sally to do so] Would there be an advantage to doing that? Patient:\u2002 I guess I might feel better. I infer from Sally\u2019s tone of voice that she might be reluctant to do the experiment. I conceptualize that automatic thoughts might be interfering.

Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. Therapist:\u2002 [providing Sally with the opposite of what I actually believed she was thinking] Were you thinking what a good time you\u2019d have with your friends? 84 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Patient:\u2002 No, I guess I\u2019m worried that my friends \u00adwon\u2019t want to hang out with me. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. [reinforcing the cognitive model] Can you see how that thought might stop you from approaching them? I mentally hypothesize the following scenario: Situation: Thinking of hanging out with friends \uf090 Automatic thought: \u201cThey \u00adwon\u2019t want to hang out with me.\u201d \uf090 Emotional reaction: Sadness? \uf090 Likely behavioral reaction (if she \u00addoesn\u2019t respond to the automatic thought): Stay in her room. Next, I determine whether Sally can devise her own response. When she cannot, I help her evaluate the validity of her thought and devise a behavioral experiment. Therapist:\u2002 How can you answer that thought? Patient:\u2002 .\u2009.\u2009. I \u00addon\u2019t know. Therapist:\u2002 Do you have any evidence that they \u00adwon\u2019t want to hang out with you? Patient:\u2002 No, not really, not unless they\u2019re busy .\u2009.\u2009. Except I\u2019m not much fun these days. Therapist:\u2002 Have they said something? Patient:\u2002 No\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Therapist:\u2002 Do you have any evidence on the other side\u2014that maybe they would want to spend time with you? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks.) Well, Emily asked me to go to lunch with her today, but I \u00adcouldn\u2019t. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, that sounds pretty good. So how could you find out for sure whether Emily or others would want to hang out? Patient:\u2002 I guess I could ask them if they want to have dinner or some- thing.

Behavioral Activation 85 Therapist:\u2002 Who would be easiest for you to ask? Emily? Patient:\u2002 No, Allison and Joe, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Then you can test two of your predictions.

Then if it turns out okay, could you keep trying to get together for friends for the rest of the week? What do you think? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, okay. Therapist:\u2002 [hypothesizing that Sally might turn her friends off if she is too down] Do you want to talk about what to say to your friends about your depression? Or how to balance talking about it with some more upbeat things? Patient:\u2002 No, I \u00addon\u2019t need to. They already know \u00adI\u2019ve been down. They\u2019re pretty supportive.

I\u2019ll do them. Therapist:\u2002 One more thing. Do you think you could give yourself credit every time you do one of these things? You could just say, \u201cGood. I did it.\u201d Patient:\u2002 (Looking quizzical.) You mean you want me to give myself credit for making plans with my friends? Therapist:\u2002 Absolutely. [providing psychoeducation] When people are depressed, it\u2019s often difficult for them to do things that they used to do easily. Doing things like calling a friend or going for just a short run are really important in starting to get yourself over the depression. And they do take more energy than lying in bed. So of course you deserve credit. Patient:\u2002 But those things used to be easy. Therapist:\u2002 When you\u2019re over the depression, you \u00addon\u2019t have to give yourself credit. But if they\u2019re even a little bit difficult to do now, you do deserve credit. And reminding yourself of that will help you recognize that you\u2019re doing something productive to get better.  87 Reprinted by permission in Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Basics and Beyond, Second Edition, by Judith S.

[See pages 274\u2013276 for a further description of giving oneself credit.] In this segment, I lead Sally to draw conclusions from a review of her typical day. Some patients need more guidance than others to do this (e.g., \u201cDo you notice how much time you spend in bed? What is your mood like when you get up\u2014do you feel much better? What changes do you think you might like to try this week?\u201d). I guide Sally to commit to implementing specific changes and identify automatic thoughts that might interfere, proposing behavioral experiments to test the validity of her negative predictions. I also ask her to give herself credit when- ever she is active. Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients believe they are incapable of becoming more active, or that becoming more active will not improve their mood? A:\t You will provide education, set up behavioral experiments to help patients test their thoughts, and use an activity chart, as below. Therapist: [summarizing a review of the patient\u2019s typical day] Okay, so it seems as if your activities changed a lot when you got depressed. Patient: Yes, I just \u00addon\u2019t have much energy. I just lie around the house most of the time. Therapist: And what\u2019s your mood been like? Patient: Pretty bad. I\u2019m depressed all the time. Therapist: And what do you think will happen if you keep lying around the house? Patient: I \u00addon\u2019t know. Nothing, I guess. Therapist: So you\u2019ll keep being depressed? Patient: I guess so. Therapist: What would you think about trying to make a bet- ter schedule for yourself, planning some things to do that could give you a sense of pleasure or achievement, like calling friends or going for walks? Patient: I \u00addon\u2019t think it would help. And I\u2019m so tired all the time. I think I should wait until I\u2019m feeling better. 90 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist: You know, that\u2019s exactly what most people with depres- sion say. But research shows us that it\u2019s actually the opposite. The way people get over their depression is to get more active first\u2014then they start to feel better. Patient: Oh. Therapist: Would you be willing to do an experiment this week\u2014 to see whether you\u2019re too tired, and to see what happens to your mood if you do try to do more things? Patient: I guess so. Therapist: Let\u2019s see. ",

Cleaning up your whole apartment? Patient: Yeah, I \u00adcouldn\u2019t do those things. Therapist: So what\u2019s something on the other side, something that takes just a little energy? Patient: (Sighs.) I could go to the library. Return my overdue book and maybe get some DVDs. Therapist: [providing positive reinforcement] Good idea! What else could you do? Patient: I\u2019m not sure. Therapist: Do you think you could do a few tasks a day\u2014if they were only for 10 minutes each? Patient: I guess I could. Therapist: Good. The therapist helps the patient specify these tasks and con- tinues to elicit additional activities, then requests that the patient use an activity chart. Therapist: These are all good activities. (pulling out the Activity Chart in Figure 6.2) I\u2019d like to figure out with you when you might do these things. Is it okay if we write them down on this chart? Patient: Okay. Therapist: (looking at the description of the patient\u2019s typical day) So, it looks as if you usually get up around 11:00 or 11:30. What would you think about getting up by 10:00 and 10:30 in the morning?  91 MON. TUE. WED. THU. FRI. SAT. SUN.

(Does so.) Therapist: Now, what do want to do after breakfast? Wash your breakfast dishes? Patient: I should. \u00adI\u2019ve been letting dishes pile up in the sink. The kitchen is kind of a mess. Therapist: So, how about doing dishes or cleaning up the kitchen for 10 minutes? You \u00addon\u2019t have to finish everything at once. Patient: (sigh of relief) Okay. Therapist: And then after the dishes? Do you want to take a break, watch TV or read the newspaper or surf the Web like you usually do? Patient: Yeah, that would be good. Therapist: Okay, so in the 11 o\u2019clock space, let\u2019s put \u201cclean kitchen for 10 minutes,\u201d and in the 12 o\u2019clock space put \u201cTV or news- paper or surf the Web.\u201d The therapist and patient continue in this vein until they have made a schedule for the next day. Because the patient has been so inactive, the therapist takes care not to overwhelm him by creat- ing too busy a schedule. She builds in short periods of activity with longer periods of leisure activity or rest. She also asks the patient to give himself credit every time he follows the schedule. Next she asks the patient if he is willing to try to follow the same basic schedule every day. They make lists of potential tasks the patient could do at home, people he could call, and places he could go. At the following session, the therapist reviews this homework assignment of following the schedule. She asks the patient about his previous predictions: that he would be too tired to do activi- ties and that they would not help. Discovering that his automatic thoughts were inaccurate can motivate the patient to get up ear- lier and engage in a greater number of productive or pleasurable activities. 94 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients \u00adcan\u2019t come up with any pleasurable activities?

See, for example, Frisch (2005) or a list described in MacPhillamy and Lewinsohn (1982), which can be accessed at: www.healthnet- solutions.com/dsp/PleasantEventsSchedule.pdf. It is useful to give a forced choice when reviewing a list with a patient: \u201cWhich five or 10 activities from the list do you think could be most enjoy- able?\u201d If patients are reluctant, it is useful to help them recognize that staying in bed maintains or increases their dysphoria. Then ask them whether they think engaging in a given activity from the list is likely to make their mood worse than staying in bed. If they reply no, ask them whether they are willing to schedule the activity. If they say yes, ask them whether they are willing to do a behavioral experiment to see if they are right. Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients are already fully scheduled or overscheduled? A:\t If patients already have a good balance of activities, they may not need to change their schedule. If the balance is not good, they may need to build in some rest time and/or increase the number of pleasurable and/or mastery activities. If they are overscheduled, they may need to decrease their activity level. (They also need to give themselves credit for making any of these changes.) In any case, if they do not gain a sense of pleasure and mastery from their activities, they may need your help in responding to the dys- functional cognitions they are experiencing. They may also need to respond to automatic thoughts that interfere with changing their activities. Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients report that changing their activities has no impact on their mood? A:\t Except in the most severe cases of depression, it is unlikely that patients experience no fluctuations in how they feel. But the fluc- tuations may be small, and patients may not remember them. For these patients, it is helpful to teach them to rate their sense of achievement and mastery on 10-point scales and to rate their mood immediately following their activities, as below. Therapist: [summarizing a review of the patient\u2019s homework] So you did a lot of things this week that we predicted could lift your mood, but you found that nothing helped? Your mood was the same, no matter what you did? Patient: Yeah.  Behavioral Activation 95 Therapist: I have two theories. One, you had interfering auto- matic thoughts. ",

The therapist then elicits the cognitions the patient had when engaging in various activities and helps him respond to them, in anticipation of their re-occurrence in the coming week. The ther- apist also ascertains that the patient had neglected to give himself credit. Next they decide to have the patient rate the sense of mas- tery and pleasure he gets. Therapist: Suppose we make up a pleasure scale first so you\u2019ll have a guideline to rate your activities [see Figure 6.3]. Now on a scale from 0 to 10, what activity would you call a 10? An activity that has given you great pleasure or that you could imagine giving you great pleasure? Patient: Oh, I guess that would be when I went to the champion- ship game [of his home football team]. Therapist: Okay, next to \u201c10\u201d write \u201cAt football game\u201d on the chart. Patient: (Does so.) Therapist: Now, what would you call a 0? An activity that gives you absolutely no pleasure? Patient: That would be arguing with my partner. Therapist: All right, write that next to 0. Patient: (Does so.) Therapist: And what would be something midway in between? Pleasure Mastery 10 Arguing with partner Building the deck 5 Dinner with brother Raking leaves last year 0 At football game Bouncing a check FIGURE 6.3.\u2002 Pleasure and Mastery Rating Scale. 96 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Patient: I guess\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. having dinner with my brother. Therapist: Good, write that. If the patient can easily match activities with numbers, these three anchor points are usually sufficient, although the patient can add more points if desired. If the patient has difficulty with numbers, you can change the anchor points to \u201clow,\u201d \u201cmedium,\u201d and \u201chigh.\u201d After completing the pleasure scale, the patient fills out the accomplishment scale in the same way. Next the therapist asks the patient to use his scales to rate today\u2019s activities. Therapist: That\u2019s good. Now let\u2019s have you fill in a little of today\u2019s schedule.

Therapist: Okay. Write \u201cbookstore\u201d in the 10 o\u2019clock block. Now, look at the scale. How much of a sense of accomplishment did you get during that hour? Patient: Maybe 2 or 3. (Writes it down.) I found the book I wanted. Therapist: And pleasure? Patient: None, really. Therapist: So being at the bookstore was like arguing with your partner? Patient: No, I guess it was about a 2. Therapist: But \u00adisn\u2019t that interesting? Your first reaction was that you got no pleasure at all. The depression probably interferes with recognizing, or maybe remembering, pleasurable activi- ties. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s worth your keeping this activity chart this week, to find out whether some activities are better than others. (pause) Do you think you\u2019re straight on what to do?  Behavioral Activation 97 Patient: Yeah. Therapist: Could you tell me why it might be worth the effort to do all this? Patient: Well, it sounds like you\u2019re saying that maybe my mood does change some, based on what I\u2019m doing. Therapist: What do you think? Patient: I guess that could be right. Therapist: If that\u2019s true, we can try to schedule more activities that do make you feel better next week. Now, the ideal thing would be to have you fill this out as close to the time you fin- ish an activity as you can\u2014so you \u00adwon\u2019t forget what you did, and so your ratings will be more accurate. If that\u2019s impossible, could you try to fill this out at lunch, dinner, and bedtime? Patient: Yeah, it \u00adshouldn\u2019t be a problem. Therapist: And if you can fill it out every day, that would give us the most information. But even if you just do a couple of days, that would give us some. Now one last thing. How about if you look over the activity chart the day before our next session? See if there are any patterns, or anything you can learn from it.

Using the Activity Chart to Assess the\u00a0Accuracy of Predictions When patients are skeptical that scheduling activities can help, you can ask them to predict levels of mastery and pleasure or mood on one activ- ity chart and then record actual ratings on another. These comparisons can be a useful source of data. Therapist:\u2002 Let\u2019s take a look now at your predictions on the first activ- ity chart and what actually happened on the second one. Patient:\u2002 (Nods.) Therapist:\u2002 Let\u2019s see\u00a0 .\u2009.\u2009. it looks as if you predicted very low scores, mostly 0\u2019s to 3\u2019s, for these three times you scheduled to meet your friends. What did happen? Patient:\u2002 Actually, I had a better time than I\u2019d thought\u2014my pleasure scores were 3\u2019s to 5\u2019s. 98 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 What does that tell you? Patient:\u2002 I guess I\u2019m not a good predictor. I thought I \u00adwouldn\u2019t enjoy myself, but I did, at least some. Therapist:\u2002 Would you like to schedule more social activities for this coming week? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I should. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Do you see what could have happened\u2014and, in fact, what was happening before you came to therapy? You kept predicting that you\u2019d have a lousy time with your friends so you \u00addidn\u2019t make any plans; in fact, you turned down their invitations. It sounds as if this therapy homework helped you test your ideas; you found it was wrong that you\u2019d have a lousy time, and now it sounds as if you\u2019re more willing to schedule more. Is that right? Patient:\u2002 Yes. But that reminds me, I wanted to talk about one predic- tion that actually turned out worse. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, when was that? Patient:\u2002 I predicted that I\u2019d get 4\u2019s in accomplishment and pleasure when I went running over the weekend. But both were 1\u2019s. Therapist:\u2002 Do you have any idea why? Patient:\u2002 Not really. Therapist:\u2002 How were you feeling when you were running? Patient:\u2002 Mostly frustrated. Therapist:\u2002 And what was going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. I \u00adwasn\u2019t feeling very good. I got winded real eas- ily. I \u00adcouldn\u2019t believe how hard it was. Therapist:\u2002 Did you have thoughts like that\u2014\u201dI \u00addon\u2019t feel very good,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m winded,\u201d \u201cThis is hard\u201d? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, I think so.

I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be able to get back in shape. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, let me see if I understand. [summarizing] Here in my office you thought you\u2019d get a moderate sense of accomplish- ment and pleasure when you went running. But instead, you got very little. It sounds as if you had a memory of how it used to be and  Behavioral Activation 99 you also had thoughts that interfered, such as, \u201cThis is hard,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m real winded,\u201d \u201cI used to do this easily,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in such bad shape now,\u201d \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll never be able to get back in shape.\u201d And these thoughts made you feel frustrated. Does that sound right? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. In this last part, the therapist uses the activity chart as a vehicle for identifying a number of automatic thoughts that were undermining the patient\u2019s enjoyment of an activity. In the next part, the therapist will: 1.\t Help him evaluate a key cognition, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll never be able to get back in shape.\u201d 2.\t Teach him to compare himself to how he was at his worst point instead of his best point, so he can feel good about running instead of being so self-critical. Behavioral activation is essential for most depressed patients. Many patients need only to be provided with a rationale, guidance in select- ing and scheduling activities, and responses to predicted automatic thoughts that might interfere with implementing the activities or with gaining a sense of pleasure or mastery from them. Therapists often need to be gently persistent in helping patients become more active. Patients who are quite inactive initially benefit from learning how to create and adhere to a daily schedule with increasing degrees of activ- ity. Patients who are skeptical about scheduling activities may benefit from doing behavioral experiments to test their ideas, and/or checking the accuracy of their automatic thoughts by comparing their predic- tions to what actually occurs.  100 Chapter 7 SESSION 2 AND BEYOND: STRUCTURE AND fORmAT S ession 2 uses a format that is repeated in every subsequent ses- sion.

This chapter presents the format and describes the general course of therapy from Session 2 to near termination. The fi nal phase of treatment is described in Chapter 18, and typical problems that arise in socializing the patient during early sessions are presented in Chap- ter 8. The typical agenda for the second session and beyond is as fol- lows: Initial Part of Session 1. Do a mood check. 2. Set the agenda. 3. Obtain an update. 4. Review homework. 5. Prioritize the agenda. Middle Part of Session 6. Work on a specifi c problem and teach cognitive behavior therapy skills in that context.  Structure and Format 101 7.\tFollow-up discussion with relevant, collaboratively set homework assignment(s). 8.\tWork on second problem. End of Session 9.\tProvide or elicit a summary. 10.\tReview new homework assignments. 11.\tElicit feedback. If you are new to this format, you can make a copy of this chart to keep with you. You can show it (or a simplified version) to patients so they can get a better idea of what treatment will be like, and so the two of you can keep track of where you are in the session. Your goals during this second session are to help patients identify important problems on which to work and, in the context of problem solving, you will teach patients relevant skills, especially identifying and responding to automatic thoughts and, for most depressed patients, scheduling activities. You will continue to socialize patients into cog- nitive behavior therapy: following the session format, working collab- oratively, providing feedback, and starting to view their past and ongo- ing experience in light of the cognitive model. If the patient is feeling somewhat better, you will also start relapse prevention work (see Chap- ter 18). Above all, you are concerned with building the therapeutic alli- ance and providing symptom relief. The First Part of the Session The specific goals of the introductory part of the session, described below, are to: Reestablish rapport. \u2022 Elicit the names of problems patients want help in solving. \u2022 Collect data that may indicate other important problem areas \u2022 to discuss.

It helps you and patients keep track of how they are progressing. If patients complete symptom checklists, you will examine them to determine whether patients have additional problems that they may not report verbally, such as suicidal ideation, difficulties sleeping, feeling worthless or punished, fearing the worst will happen, increased irritability, and so on. It may be important to address one or more of these problems during the session. You will also elicit a subjective description from patients and match it with objective test scores. If there is a discrepancy between the test scores and the self-report, question the patient (e.g., \u201cSo \u00adyou\u2019ve been feeling worse, but your depression inventory is actually lower than last week. What do you make of that?\u201d). You will also make a quick compari- son between the objective scores of the previous session and the present objective scores (e.g., \u201cYour anxiety score is lower this week than last. Have you been feeling less anxious?\u201d). You should also confirm that patients are not reporting how they feel just that day, but instead are providing an overview of their mood for the past week. A typical second session begins as follows: Therapist:\u2002 Hi, Sally. How have you been feeling? Patient:\u2002 About the same, I guess. I\u2019m still feeling pretty depressed. And a lot more worried. Therapist:\u2002 Can I take a look at your forms? When you filled them out, were you thinking about the week as a whole\u2014or just today? Patient:\u2002 The whole week. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Okay, yes, it sure looks like you were much more anxious this week. Should we put \u201canxiety\u201d on the agenda to talk about in a few minutes? 1.\t What did we talk about last session that was important? What do my therapy notes say? 2.\t What has my mood been like, compared to other weeks? 3.\t What happened (positive and negative) this week that my therapist should know? 4.\t What problems do I want help in solving?

FIGURE 7.1.\u2002 Preparing for Therapy Worksheet.  Structure and Format 103 Patient:\u2002 (Nods.) Therapist:\u2002 (indicating the Beck Depression Inventory) It looks like your depression score is down a little this week, compared to last week. Did it feel that way to you? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, I think so. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, that\u2019s good. Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients elaborate at length about their mood? A:\t You will socialize them to give a concise description. For exam- ple: \u201cSally, can I interrupt you for a moment? Can you tell me in just a couple of sentences how your depression and anxiety have been this week compared to last week? Have you been feeling more depressed, about the same, or less depressed?\u201d Having gained an overall sense of Sally\u2019s mood in the past week, I elicit her attribution for the change. I want her to recognize the positive actions she took and the adaptive changes in her thinking. Therapist:\u2002 Why do you think you\u2019re a little less depressed? Patient:\u2002 I guess \u00adI\u2019ve been feeling a little more hopeful, like maybe therapy might help. Therapist:\u2002 [subtly reinforcing the cognitive model] So you had thoughts like, \u201cTherapy might help,\u201d and those thoughts made you feel more hopeful, less depressed? Patient:\u2002 Yes\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. and Lisa\u2014she\u2019s in my chemistry class\u2014asked me to study with her. We spent a couple of hours yesterday going over some formulas. That made me feel better, too. Therapist:\u2002 What went through your mind when you were studying with her yesterday? Patient:\u2002 That I was glad she asked me to study with her\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I under- stand it more now. Therapist:\u2002 So we have two good examples of why you felt better this week. One, you had hopeful thoughts about therapy. And two, you did something different\u2014studying with Lisa\u2014and got at least a small sense of achievement. Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 Can you see how your thinking and what you did affected how you felt\u2014in a positive way? ",

If patients have been feeling better but are unsure why, ask, \u201cHave you noticed any changes in your thinking or in what \u00adyou\u2019ve been doing?\u201d Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients attribute positive changes in their mood to external factors? A:\t Patients often say, \u201cI felt better because the medication started working/my boss was out sick/my partner was nicer to me.\u201d You might then suggest, \u201cI\u2019m sure that helped, but did you also find yourself thinking differently or doing anything different?\u201d Likewise, you will seek patients\u2019 attributions if their mood has wors- ened: \u201cWhy do you think you\u2019re feeling worse this week? Could it have anything to do with your thinking, or with the things you did or \u00addidn\u2019t do?\u201d In this way, you subtly reinforce the cognitive model and imply that patients can take some control over how they feel. Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients state that nothing can improve their mood? A:\t For some patients who persist in this belief, it might be helpful to put \u201cThings that can help me feel better and things that can help me feel worse\u201d on the agenda to discuss later in session. A chart such as the one in Figure 7.2 can help reinforce the notion that patients can take at least minimal control of their mood. Through guided discovery, you can help them see that avoidance, isolation, Things that make me feel better Things that make me feel worse Riding my bike Getting through my e-mails Going on Facebook Meeting up with friends Working on the car Staying in bed Taking long naps Watching too much TV Sitting around FIGURE 7.2.\u2002 A better/worse list.

The brief mood check creates several opportunities: You demonstrate your concern for how patients have been \u2022 feeling in the past week. You and they can monitor how they have been progressing over \u2022 the course of treatment. You can identify (and then reinforce or modify) their explanation \u2022 for progress or lack thereof. You can also reinforce the cognitive model; namely, how patients \u2022 have been viewing situations and how they have been behaving have influenced their mood. When reviewing objective measures, make sure to review individual items to look for important positive or negative changes (e.g., changes in suicidal ideation or hopelessness). According to patients\u2019 diagnoses and symptomatology, you might also ask for additional information not specifically covered in the tests (e.g., number and severity of panic attacks, binges, substance use, angry outbursts, self-harm, destructive behavior). If patients are taking medication for their psychological difficul- ties, you will briefly check on adherence, problems, side effects, or questions. It is important to phrase the adherence question in terms of frequency\u2014not \u201cDid you take your medicine this week,\u201d but rather, \u201cHow many times this week were you able to take your medicine the way [the provider] prescribed?\u201d (See, e.g., J. S. Beck, 2001, for suggestions on how to increase medication adherence.) If you are not the prescribing healthcare provider, you will obtain patients\u2019 permission and then periodically contact the provider to exchange information. You will not recommend changes in medica- tion, but you might help patients respond to cognitions that interfere with their taking medication (or, if applicable, reducing medication). If they have concerns about issues such as side effects, dosage, addiction to medications, or alternative medications or supplements, you will help patients write down specific questions to ask their provider. If patients are not taking medication but you believe a pharmacological intervention is indicated, you might suggest a medical or psychiatric consultation. 106 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Setting an Initial Agenda The purpose of this brief segment is to set an initial agenda.

Rather than asking, \u201cWhat do you want to talk about today?\u201d or \u201cWhat do you want to put on the agenda?\u201d(which can lead to less pro- ductive discussions), you phrase the question in a problem-solving way (until patients are socialized to setting the agenda in this way): Therapist:\u2002 Okay, Sally, what problem or problems do you want my help in solving today? Can you just tell me the names of the problems? Patient:\u2002 Well, \u00adI\u2019ve got this economics exam coming up and I just \u00addon\u2019t understand the material. \u00adI\u2019ve been so worried. I just \u00adcan\u2019t concen- trate. I \u00addon\u2019t know what to do. I keep reading\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Therapist:\u2002 (gently interrupting) [socializing the patient into briefly specifying a problem to be discussed later in the session] Should we put the exam on the agenda? Patient:\u2002 Yes, definitely. Rather than having Sally provide a full description of the problem at this point, I gently interrupt her, name the problem, and ask to put it on the agenda to discuss in a few minutes. Had I allowed her to launch into a lengthier description of the problem, I would have deprived her of the opportunity to reflect on and prioritize what she most wanted to talk about during the session, which may or may not have been the first problem she brought up. Next I probe for additional important agenda topics: Therapist:\u2002 Are there any other problems you want help with? Patient:\u2002 Well, things \u00adaren\u2019t going too well with my roommate. We keep such different hours. She\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Therapist:\u2002 (gently interrupting) Should we call that, \u201cproblem with your roommate\u201d? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 Anything else? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure. Therapist:\u2002 [probing for other problems that might be even more important to address during the session than these first two] When did you feel the worst this week? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks.) I guess when I was trying to study for the exam. And in class. Therapist:\u2002 Any other times that were particularly bad? Patient:\u2002 No, those were the worst.

I then ascertain whether the patient anticipates the occurrence of other important difficulties before I see her again: Therapist:\u2002 And are there any other problems you think are likely to come up this week? Patient:\u2002 No, I \u00addon\u2019t think so. Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients have difficulty coming up with agenda items? A:\t Often patients need a little encouragement initially to suggest agenda items. They may not be clearly cognizant of what has been bothering them, and/or they may be unsure of what is appropri- ate to bring up. Chapter 8 describes what to do with patients who display this difficulty. Update of Week The next part of the session helps you make a bridge between the pre- vious session and the current one. It includes a brief update of the patient\u2019s week, during which you will remain alert for potential prob- lems that could be important for the agenda. First you seek to get the general gist of how the patient\u2019s week went. Therapist:\u2002 Did anything else happen this week that\u2019s important for me to know? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks.) Ummm. (sigh) Yeah, I overslept and missed a class. Therapist:\u2002 [probing to see whether it is important enough to add to the agenda] Is that a problem we need to talk about today? Patient:\u2002 No, I \u00addon\u2019t think so. I just forgot to set my alarm. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, anything else? Patient:\u2002 No, not that I can think of. Next you will elicit positive experiences: Therapist:\u2002 All right. Now, can you tell me what happened this week that was positive? Or situations in which maybe you felt a little bit better? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks.) Umm, I think running helped. I also felt better when I talked to my mom on the phone. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, that\u2019s good. Were there any other good things that happened? 108 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Asking for positive experiences helps patients realize that they did not feel the same unrelenting severity of distress for the entire week. You should note the positive data, which you may use later in the session or in future sessions, especially when planning positive activities for patients to engage in or when helping them evaluate relevant automatic thoughts and beliefs. Uncovering positive data may also put patients in a better frame of mind, making them more receptive to upcoming prob- lem solving. ",

You may decide to engage patients conversationally about these items (usually briefly), either at the time or later, to brighten their mood or to demonstrate your interest in them, thereby strengthening the therapeutic alliance. Homework Review Next you will find out what the patient accomplished for homework. (Chapter 17 provides a more extensive description of this part of the session.) Reviewing the patient\u2019s homework is critical. If you do not, patients invariably stop doing it. Sometimes the review of homework is relatively brief; at other times, however, it may become the major part of the session, if it is related to the problems on the agenda. Part of the\u00a0art of therapy is determining how much time to spend reviewing homework versus discussing other problems the patient wants help in solving. Generally you ask patients to read aloud the assignments from their Homework List (see, e.g., page 67). You ask them to rate how much they currently believe the adaptive statements, the responses to their auto- matic thoughts and beliefs you discussed in the previous sessions(s). You find out which behavioral assignments they did and what they learned from them. And you discuss which assignments would be helpful for them to continue in the coming week. If any homework items require a lengthy discussion (or if there are any assignments they failed to do), you can collaboratively decide to discuss them later in the session, so you can quickly review the rest of the assignments. Therapist:\u2002 Next, can we talk about your homework? Do you have the notes from last week? Patient:\u2002 Yes (Pulls out list [Figure 5.1, page 67]; therapist pulls out her copy, too.) Therapist:\u2002 Good. Okay if we go through it? Patient:\u2002 Sure. Therapist:\u2002 So how did you do with reading this twice a day? Patient:\u2002 Pretty good. I think I only missed one or two days.  Structure and Format 109 Therapist:\u2002 Can you read the first item? Patient:\u2002 (Reads aloud.) \u201cIf I start thinking I\u2019m lazy and no good, remind myself that I have a real illness, called depression, that makes it harder for me to do things. As the treatment starts to work, my depression will lift, and things will get easier.\u201d Therapist:\u2002 How much do you believe that right now? Patient:\u2002 I guess I do believe it.

(Moving on to third item) Were you able to catch your automatic thoughts when you noticed your mood changing? Patient:\u2002 I tried, but I \u00addon\u2019t think I always know what I\u2019m thinking. Therapist:\u2002 That\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll be talking about automatic thoughts at every session. Were you able to identify any automatic thoughts when your mood changed? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, I think so, but I \u00addidn\u2019t write them down. Therapist:\u2002 What was the situation? Patient:\u2002 I was sitting in class, and all of a sudden I got really nervous. Therapist:\u2002 What was going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 I was thinking the exam was coming up, and there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be ready for it. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Let me jot that down. Can we get back to this thought in a few minutes when we talk about the exam? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 Any other automatic thoughts you were aware of this week? Patient:\u2002 Not really. Therapist:\u2002 So you \u00addidn\u2019t get much of an opportunity to remind your- self that just because you think something \u00addoesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s true? Patient:\u2002 (Shakes her head.) Therapist:\u2002 What do you think of that idea now? Patient:\u2002 I guess it\u2019s true. Like the Coping with Depression booklet says. Therapist:\u2002 Did you get together with Allison or Joe or other people this week? 110 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Sally and I quickly review this assignment. We collaboratively agree that she will continue to look for her automatic thoughts and make social plans in the coming week. Then we briefly discuss key concepts in the Coping with Depression booklet. Prioritizing the Agenda Now that you have set an initial agenda and possibly added more top- ics as you collected data about the patient\u2019s week and homework, you will summarize the topics. If there are too many agenda items, you and the patient will collaboratively prioritize items and agree to move the discussion of less important problems to a future session. You may also find out whether patients want to spend about an equal amount of time on each item. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, can we prioritize the agenda now [providing a ratio- nale] so we can figure out how to spend our time this session? ",

Patient:\u2002 Ummm\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I guess the problem with my roommate. It\u2019ll prob- ably just blow over. And my cousin. That can wait.

When deviating from the agenda, however, you should explic- itly note the change and elicit the patient\u2019s agreement. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, I can see that you\u2019re still worried about your exam, but we\u2019re running out of time. Would you like to spend the rest of the session on it and postpone our other agenda items to next week?

Patient: Then another time I was trying to study in the library and I got so distracted when I saw this girl from my high school, Julia. I just started to obsess over whether I should go talk to her. When we were in 10th grade, Julia was pretty friendly, and then something happened, I\u2019m not sure what it was. I think she may have\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Therapist: Can I just interrupt you for a moment? We started off talking about the trouble \u00adyou\u2019ve been having studying for your exam, and now it sounds as if the focus is Julia. Is it more important to you to go back to talking about the exam, or is Julia more important to talk about? Patient: Oh, the exam. Julia\u2019s not that important. Therapist: Okay, so you were saying that it\u2019s generally hard for you to get to work at the library? 112 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND You steer patients away from peripheral issues that were not on the original agenda, and which hold little promise for helping them prog- ress during the session. A notable exception occurs when you deliber- ately (though usually briefly) engage patients in more casual conversa- tion to achieve a specific goal. For example, you might ask about their family, movies, or social events they have recently attended to brighten their mood, facilitate the alliance, or assess their cognitive functioning or social skills. The Middle Part of the Session Next you will list the names of the problems on the prioritized agenda and ask patients which problem they want to work on first. Doing so affords them the opportunity to be active and take responsibility. At times, though, you may take the lead in suggesting an agenda item with which to start, especially when you judge that a particular problem is the most important. ",

(\u201cIs it okay with you if we start with the problem of finding a part-time job?\u201d) You will collect data about the problem, conceptualize the patients\u2019 difficulties according to the cognitive model, and collaboratively decide on which part of the cognitive model you will begin working (solving the problem situation, evaluating automatic thoughts, reducing patients\u2019 immediate distress (if the patients\u2019 affect is so high they cannot focus on problem solving, evaluating thoughts, or behavioral change), sug- gesting behavioral changes (and teaching behavioral skills if needed), or decreasing patients\u2019 physiological arousal (if it is interfering with an important discussion). In the context of discussing problems on the agenda, you will be teaching patients skills and setting new homework. You will also make periodic summaries, if needed, to help you and the patient recall what you have been doing in this part of the session. In discussing the first problem (and subsequent problems), you will interweave your therapy goals as appropriate. In this second session, I seek not only to help Sally do some problem solving, but also to: Reinforce the cognitive model. \u2022 Continue teaching Sally to identify her automatic thoughts. \u2022 Provide some symptom relief through helping Sally \u2022 respond to her anxious thoughts. As always, maintain and build rapport through accurate \u2022 understanding.  Structure and Format 113 Agenda Item No. 1 Therapist:\u2002 Okay, let\u2019s take a look at the agenda. Where do you think we should start? We could talk about your exam, your mood when you\u2019re studying or when you\u2019re in the library, or the course of improvement. Patient:\u2002 My economics exam, I guess, I\u2019m really worried about it. Therapist:\u2002 [collecting data] Okay, can you give me an overview of what happened this week? How much did you study? What hap- pened with your concentration? Patient:\u2002 Well, I meant to study all the time. But every time I sat down, I just got so nervous. Sometimes I \u00addidn\u2019t realize that my mind had wandered, and I had to keep rereading the same page. Therapist:\u2002 [continuing to collect data so I can help problem-solve and identify possible distortions in Sally\u2019s thinking] When is the exam, and how many chapters does it cover? Patient:\u2002 It\u2019s in 2 weeks, and I think it covers the first five chapters. Therapist:\u2002 And how many chapters have you read at least once? Patient:\u2002 About three. ",

Therapist:\u2002 And there are still some things in these first three chapters that you \u00addon\u2019t understand? Patient:\u2002 A lot of things. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. So, in a nutshell, you have an exam in 2 weeks, and you\u2019re worried that you \u00adwon\u2019t understand the material well enough? Patient:\u2002 Right. In this first part, I seek an overview of the problem. I subtly model how to express this problem succinctly. Next, I help Sally identify her auto- matic thoughts by having her recall a specific situation. Therapist:\u2002 Can you remember a time this week when you thought about studying or tried to study, and the anxiety got really bad? Patient:\u2002 Yes, sure\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. last night. Therapist:\u2002 What time was it? Where were you? Patient:\u2002 It was about 7:30. I was walking to the library. Therapist:\u2002 Can you picture it in your head now? It\u2019s 7:30, you\u2019re walk- ing to the library.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. What goes through your mind? Patient:\u2002 What if I flunk the exam? What if I flunk the course? How will I ever make it through the semester? 114 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 Okay, so you were able to identify your automatic thoughts. And how did these thoughts make you feel? Anxious? Patient:\u2002 Very. Therapist:\u2002 Let me tell you a little more about these automatic thoughts. We call them automatic because they seem just to pop into your mind. Most of the time, you\u2019re probably not even aware of them; you\u2019re probably much more aware of how you\u2019re feeling emotion- ally. Even if you are aware of them, you probably \u00addon\u2019t think to evaluate how accurate your thoughts are. You just accept them as true. Patient:\u2002 Hmmm. Therapist:\u2002 What you\u2019ll learn to do here in therapy is first to identify your thoughts, and then judge for yourself whether they\u2019re com- pletely true, partially true, or not true at all. (pause) Can we look at the first thought together? [starting the process of evaluating the automatic thought] What evidence do you have that you\u2019ll flunk the exam? Patient:\u2002 Well, I \u00addon\u2019t understand everything. Therapist:\u2002 Anything else? Patient:\u2002 No\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. just that I\u2019m running out of time. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. Any evidence that you might not flunk? Patient:\u2002 Well, I did do okay on the first quiz. Therapist:\u2002 Anything else? Patient:\u2002 I guess I understand the first two chapters better than the third one. ",

I could look through my lecture notes. Therapist:\u2002 Anything else? Patient:\u2002 (Hesitates.) I \u00adcan\u2019t think of anything. Therapist:\u2002 Anyone else you could ask for help? Patient:\u2002 Well, I suppose I could ask Sean; he\u2019s the teaching assistant. Or maybe Ross, the guy down the hall who took this course last year. Therapist:\u2002 That sounds good. Did you think of asking either of them for help this week? Did any automatic thoughts get in the way? Patient:\u2002 No, I guess I just \u00addidn\u2019t even think of it.  Structure and Format 115 Therapist:\u2002 Whom do you think would be better to ask? Patient:\u2002 Sean, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 How likely are you to ask him? Patient:\u2002 I will. He has office hours tomorrow morning. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, assuming you get help this week, what do you think of your prediction that you might flunk? Patient:\u2002 Well, I guess I do know some of the stuff. Maybe I could get help with the rest. Therapist:\u2002 And how do you feel now? Patient:\u2002 A little less worried, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, to summarize, you had a lot of automatic thoughts this week that made you feel anxious. But when you stop to evaluate these thoughts, it seems likely that there are some things you can do to pass. When you really look at the evidence and answer the thoughts, you feel better\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Is that right? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, that\u2019s true. Therapist:\u2002 For homework this week, I\u2019d like you to look for these auto- matic thoughts again when you notice your mood changing. These thoughts may have a grain of truth, but often I think you\u2019ll find that they\u2019re not necessarily completely true. Next week we\u2019ll look for evidence together to figure out whether the thoughts you wrote down for homework are completely accurate. Okay? Patient:\u2002 Okay.

See what you can do this week just to identify some thoughts, but \u00addon\u2019t expect yourself to be good at it yet. Okay? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 One more word about this. When you write down some thoughts this week, remind yourself again that the thoughts may or may not be true. Otherwise, writing them down before \u00adyou\u2019ve learned to evaluate them could make you feel a little worse. Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 Let\u2019s write this assignment down.

[See Figure 7.3.] 116 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND In this section, I accomplish many things at once. I address a prob- lem from the agenda that is of concern to Sally; I teach her more about automatic thoughts; I help her identify, evaluate, and respond to a specific distressing thought; I facilitate symptom relief by decreasing her anxiety; and I set up a homework assignment and advise Sally to have realistic expectations about learning the new skill. Chapters 9\u201312 describe in greater detail the process of teaching patients to identify and evaluate their automatic thoughts. Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I \u00addon\u2019t know how to help patients solve a particular problem? A:\t There are several things you can do: Find out how they have already tried to solve the problem and \u2022 why it \u00addidn\u2019t work. You may be able to modify the solution or modify thoughts that got in the way of the solution working. Use yourself as a model. Ask yourself, \u201cIf I had this problem, \u2022 what would I do?\u201d Ask the patient to name another person (usually a friend or \u2022 family member) who could conceivably have the same kind of problem. What advice would the patient give him or her? See whether that advice could apply to the patient. Jan. 29 Read this list twice a day 1.\t When I notice my mood changing, ask myself, \u201cWhat\u2019s going through my mind right now?\u201d and jot down my automatic thoughts (which may or may not be completely true).

Structure and Format 117 If \u2022 you\u2019re stuck, postpone the discussion: \u201cI\u2019d like to think more about the problem this week. Could we put it on the agenda to talk more about next week?\u201d  Also, see pages 256\u2013258 for a further description of problem solv- ing. Agenda Item No. 2 In the next section of the therapy session, I provide Sally with some information about the course of improvement. Having just finished a segment of the session, I briefly summarize first: Therapist:\u2002 Okay, we just finished talking about your exam and how your automatic thoughts really made you feel anxious and inter- fered with problem solving. Next, I\u2019d like to talk about the course of getting better, if that\u2019s okay. Patient:\u2002 Sure. Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling a little less depressed today, and I hope you continue to feel better. But probably you \u00adwon\u2019t just feel a little bit better every single week until you\u2019re back to your old self. You should expect to have your ups and downs. Now I\u2019m telling you this for a reason. Can you imagine what you might think if you expected to keep feeling better and better and then one day you felt a lot worse? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019d probably think I would never get better. Therapist:\u2002 That\u2019s right. So I want you to remember that we predicted a possible setback, that setbacks are a normal part of getting better. Do you want to get down something in writing about that? See Chapter 18 for a more extensive discussion of relapse prevention and a pictorial representation of the normal course of therapy. Periodic Summaries Three kinds of summarizing are important throughout sessions. The first summarizes content. Patients often describe a problem with many details. You will summarize what they have said in the form of the cog- nitive model to ensure that you have correctly identified what is most troublesome to patients, and to present it in a way that is more concise and clear.

You will summarize what they have said in the form of the cog- nitive model to ensure that you have correctly identified what is most troublesome to patients, and to present it in a way that is more concise and clear. You use patients\u2019 own words as much as possible, both to convey accurate understanding and to keep the key difficulty activated in their mind: 118 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 Let me make sure I understand. You were considering get- ting a part-time job again, but then you thought, \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to handle it,\u201d and the thought made you so sad that you turned off your computer and went back to bed and cried for half an hour. Is that right? Had I paraphrased the patient\u2019s ideas and failed to use her own words (\u201cSounds like you \u00adweren\u2019t sure if you could do well if you got a part- time job\u201d), I might have lessened the intensity of the automatic thought and emotion, and our subsequent evaluation of the thought might then have been less effective. Summaries that substitute the therapist\u2019s words may also lead to patients\u2019 believing that they have not been accurately understood: Patient:\u2002 No, it\u2019s not that I thought I might not do well; I\u2019m afraid I might not be able to handle it at all. You will often ask patients to make a second kind of summary after you have evaluated an automatic thought or belief: \u201cCan you summarize what we just talked about?\u201d Or \u201cWhat do you think the main message is here?\u201d Or \u201cWhat do you think would be important for you to remember?\u201d If patients do a good job of summarizing, you or they should write down this summary so they can read it for homework. If their summary misses the mark, you might say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s close, but I wonder if it would be more helpful if you remembered it this way\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009.\u201d If the patient agrees, the latter summary is recorded in their notes. The third is a brief summary when a section of a session has been completed, so both therapist and patient have a clear understanding of what they have just accomplished and what they will do next: Therapist:\u2002 Okay, so \u00adwe\u2019ve finished talking about the course of treat- ment. Next, should we talk about the problem with your cousin? ",

Final Summary and Feedback The goal of the final summary is to focus the patient\u2019s attention on the most important points of the session in a positive way. In early sessions, you will generally summarize.  Structure and Format 119 Therapist:\u2002 Well, we have just a few minutes left. Let me summarize what we covered today, and then I\u2019ll ask you for your reaction to the session. Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 It sounds like when you had more hopeful thoughts this week, you felt less depressed. But then your anxiety increased because you had all these negative thoughts about your exam. When we looked at the evidence that you\u2019ll flunk, though, it seemed unconvincing. And you came up with a couple of good strategies to help your studying, some of which you\u2019ll try between now and our next session. We also discussed what you should remind yourself if you have a setback. Finally, we talked about having you continue to go running. And we went over identifying and evaluating your automatic thoughts, which is a skill we\u2019ll keep practicing in therapy. (pause) Do you think that about covers it? Patient:\u2002 Yes. As the patient progresses, the therapist may ask the patient to sum- marize the most important points. Summarizing is much more easily accomplished if the patient has taken good notes during the session: Therapist:\u2002 Okay, Sally, we just have a few minutes left. What do you think is going to be most important for you to remember this week? You can look at your notes. Following the final summary, the therapist elicits feedback about the session from the patient. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, Sally, what did you think about the session today? Was there anything I said that bothered you? Anything you think I got wrong? Patient:\u2002 I am a little bit worried that I could have a setback. Therapist:\u2002 Well, a setback is possible, and if you do find yourself feel- ing significantly worse before our next session, I\u2019d like you to call me and we can discuss whether you should come in sooner. On the other hand, you may very well have another better week. Patient:\u2002 I hope so. Therapist:\u2002 Should we put the topic \u201csetbacks\u201d on the agenda again next week? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I think so. 120 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 Anything else about the session? Anything you want us to do differently next time? ",

Patient:\u2002 No, I \u00addon\u2019t think so. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. See you next week. If you sense that patients have not fully expressed their reaction to the session, you may ask them to complete a therapy report (see Figure 5.2). When patients do express negative feedback, you will positively reinforce them and then try to solve the problem. If there is insufficient time to do so, you may apologize and tell patients that you would like to discuss their negative reaction at the very beginning of the following session. Negative feedback usually indicates difficulty in the therapeu- tic alliance (discussed more fully in J. S. Beck, 2005). Session 3 and Beyond Later therapy sessions maintain the same basic format. The content var- ies according to the patient\u2019s problems and goals, and your therapeutic goals. In this section, I outline the flow of therapy across sessions. A more detailed description of treatment planning can be found in Chapter 19. As mentioned previously, you initially take the lead in helping patients identify and modify automatic thoughts, devising homework assignments, and summarizing the session. As therapy progresses, there is a gradual shift in responsibility. Toward the end of therapy, patients themselves tend to identify their distorted thinking, devise their own homework assignments, and summarize the session. Another gradual shift is from an emphasis on automatic thoughts to a focus on both automatic thoughts and underlying beliefs (see Chap- ters 13 and 14). As therapy moves into the final phase, there is another shift: preparing the patient for termination and relapse prevention (see Chapter 18). When planning an individual session, you are mindful of the stage of therapy and you continue to use your conceptualization of the patient to guide treatment, noting potential agenda items before a session. As patients report on their mood, briefly review the week, and specify agenda topics, you formulate in your own mind a specific goal or goals for the session. For example, in Session 3, my goals for Sally (though not necessarily for all depressed patients) are to begin teaching her in a structured way to evaluate her automatic thoughts and to continue to schedule pleasurable activities. In Session 4, I aim to help Sally do some problem solving about finding a part-time job and continue to respond to her dysfunctional thoughts. ",

I continually  Structure and Format 121 seek to integrate my goals with Sally\u2019s agenda items. Thus I teach her problem-solving and cognitive restructuring skills in the context of situ- ations she brings to therapy. This combination of solving problems and helping patients respond to their thoughts generally allows the novice therapist sufficient time to discuss in depth only about two problematic situations from the agenda during a given therapy session. Experienced therapists can often cover more. To refine your conceptualization, to keep track of what is being covered in a therapy session, and to plan future sessions, you take notes during the session (see Figure 7.4) and keep a copy of notes the patient takes. It is useful to note the problem(s) discussed, dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs written verbatim (and the degree to which the patient initially believed them), interventions made in session, newly restructured thoughts and beliefs (and the degree of belief in them), the assigned homework, and topics for the agendas of future sessions. Even experienced therapists have difficulty remembering all these important items without written notes. FIGURE 7.4.\u2002 Therapy notes.

FIGURE 7.4.\u2002 (cont.)  123 Chapter 8 PROBlEmS WITH STRUCTURING THE THERAPY SESSION P roblems invariably arise in structuring sessions. When you become aware of a problem, you will specify it, conceptualize why the prob- lem arose, and devise a solution. If you have correctly diagnosed the patient and developed a sound treatment plan but still have diffi culties in structuring sessions, you should check on the following: Have you failed to gently interrupt the patient to direct the session? \u2022 Have you failed to socialize the patient into treatment? \u2022 Have you failed to suffi ciently engage the patient in treatment or to \u2022 develop a strong therapeutic alliance? These diffi culties are described in this chapter. Then problems and remedies for each segment of a typical session are offered. THERAPIST COGNITIONS If you are a novice therapist or a therapist experienced in a less direc- tive modality, you may have interfering cognitions about structure, interrupting patients, and implementing the standard structure. 124 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Automatic Thoughts \u201cI \u00adcan\u2019t structure the session.\u201d \u201c[My patient] \u00adwon\u2019t like the structure.\u201d \u201cShe \u00adcan\u2019t express herself succinctly.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll get mad if I\u2019m too directive.\u201d \u201cI \u00adshouldn\u2019t interrupt her.\u201d \u201cHe \u00adwon\u2019t do homework.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll feel invalidated if I evaluate her thinking.\u201d You should monitor your own level of discomfort and identify your automatic thoughts during and between sessions.

You can then identify a problem, evaluate and respond to your thoughts, and problem-solve to make it easier for you to experiment with implementing the standard structure at the next session. Interrupting the Patient To structure sessions effectively so therapy can proceed most efficiently, you need to use gentle interruption. In the following transcript, the therapist finds himself feeling slightly overwhelmed by the patient\u2019s out- pouring of problems. He uses his own emotional reaction as a cue to interrupt and structure the patient. Patient:\u2002 And then, I \u00adcouldn\u2019t believe it, but my sister told me\u2014told me!\u2014that I had to go help out Mom. She knows that I \u00adcan\u2019t do that. I mean, my mother and I have never gotten along. If I go over, she\u2019ll just bombard me with stuff to do. And she\u2019ll criticize me. I just \u00adcan\u2019t take any more criticism. I get it all day at work and\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Therapist:\u2002 Can I interrupt you for a minute? I want to make sure I get what\u2019s been going on. We started talking about holiday plans and what you should do and then you described a few more problems. Which do you think would be most important to work on? Holiday plans, your sister, mom, or work? Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients get upset when you interrupt? A:\t If they do not spontaneously tell you that your interruptions were distressing, ask them what was just going through their minds when you notice a negative affect shift. If they fail to identify their  Problems with Structuring the Session 125 automatic thoughts, you can offer your hypothesis: \u201cI was won- dering whether you thought I was interrupting you too much?\u201d Once you ascertain that interrupting has been a problem, posi- tively reinforce them: \u201cIt\u2019s good you told me that.\u201d Next, apolo- gize; simply say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d (An apology is in order because you have apparently misgauged how much interruption they could tolerate.)

Then solve the problem, for example, by asking patients if they would like to talk without interruption for the next 5 or 10 minutes, at the end of which time you will summarize what they said, \u201cBecause it\u2019s important to me that I really understand what\u2019s going on with you.\u201d Socializing the Patient A second common difficulty in maintaining the prescribed structure can arise if you do not adequately socialize patients. Patients who are new to cognitive behavior therapy do not know in advance that you would like them to report on the week, describe their mood, and set the agenda in a succinct way. They do not know that you will ask them to summarize discussions of important problems, provide feedback, remember session content, and consistently do daily homework. In addition, you are essentially teaching patients certain skills and also a new way of relating to you (for those who have been in another type of therapy), or a new way of relating to their difficulties so that they can adopt a more objective, problem-solving orientation. Therefore, you must often describe, provide a rationale, and monitor with gentle, cor- rective feedback each of the session elements. Engaging the Patient A third common difficulty arises when patients have dysfunctional beliefs that interfere with their ability to commit to working in treat- ment. They may not have clear goals (described in Chapter 5) that they really want to achieve. They may have unrealistic hopes that they will somehow get better without doing the work of therapy. They may feel hopeless about their ability to solve problems, affect their life, or change. They may even fear that if they get better, their life will get worse in some way (e.g., they will lose you as a therapist, or have to return to work). You need to be alert for the possibility of these kinds of interfering cognitions and help patients respond to them so they will be more amenable to the structure and tasks of treatment. 126 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Strengthening the Therapeutic Alliance A fourth common difficulty involves patients\u2019 unwillingness to con- form to the prescribed structure because of their perceptions of and dysfunctional beliefs about themselves, about therapy, or about you.

If you believe it will not interfere with the alliance, you may acknowledge patients\u2019 discomfort, but encourage them to comply as an experiment. At the other end of the spectrum, you may allow the patient to domi- nate and control the flow of the session\u2014initially. With most patients, however, you will negotiate a compromise satisfactory to both of you, and you will try, over time, to move the patient toward the standard structure. How do you determine whether the difficulty in adherence to ses- sion structure is due to faulty socialization or reluctance in comply- ing? You first intervene by further socializing patients to the cognitive behavior therapy model and by monitoring their verbal and nonverbal responses. If it is simply a problem in socialization, patients\u2019 responses are fairly neutral (or perhaps slightly self-critical), and subsequent com- pliance is good. Therapist:\u2002 Can I interrupt for a moment? Can we get back to what happened when you called your friend? Patient:\u2002 Oh, sure. When patients react negatively, they have undoubtedly perceived your request in a negative way, and you need to switch gears. Patient:\u2002 (irritably) But this thing with my mother is really upsetting. Therapist:\u2002 Oh, should we spend a few minutes on your mom, then? We may not have time, though, to get back to talking about David. Is that okay? Problems can also arise if you impose structure in a controlling or\u00a0 demanding fashion. If patients are reluctant to provide you with honest feedback about how overbearing you are, you may not know you have made this mistake. It will be important for you to review a record- ing of the session, or better yet, have a peer, colleague, or supervisor review it. Then you can model apologizing, and remedy the problem at the next session: \u201cI think I came across as too heavy-handed last week. I\u2019m sorry, I do want to make sure that you agree with how the session goes.\u201d Typical problems with each stage of the therapy session, excluding significant mistakes therapists make, are presented below.  Problems with Structuring the Session 127 Mood Check Common problems involve patients\u2019 failure to fill out forms, annoy- ance with forms, or difficulty in subjectively expressing (in a concise manner) their general mood during the week.

Problems with Structuring the Session 127 Mood Check Common problems involve patients\u2019 failure to fill out forms, annoy- ance with forms, or difficulty in subjectively expressing (in a concise manner) their general mood during the week. If the difficulty is sim- ply faulty socialization relating to completing the forms, you can ask patients whether they remember and agree with the rationale for fill- ing them out, and determine whether there\u2019s a practical difficulty that needs to be resolved (e.g., insufficient time, forgetting, or a problem in literacy). When patients are annoyed by the request to fill out the forms, you can ask for their automatic thoughts when thinking about or actually filling them out, or you can ask for the significance of the situation: \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst part about them?\u201d Or \u201cWhat does it mean that \u00adI\u2019ve asked you to fill out these forms?\u201d You can then empathically respond to patients\u2019 concerns, help them evaluate relevant thoughts and beliefs, and/or do problem solving. These responses are provided in the three examples below. Patient:\u2002 These forms \u00addon\u2019t really seem to apply to me. Half of the questions are irrelevant. Therapist:\u2002 Yes, I know. But actually they\u2019re helpful to me\u2014I can look at them quickly and get the overall picture, and not bother you with dozens of questions. Would you be willing to fill them out again next week, and we can talk more about them then if they still bother you? In the next example, the patient clearly expresses his annoyance through his choice of words, tone of voice, and body language. Patient:\u2002 These forms are a waste of time. Half the questions are irrel- evant. Therapist:\u2002 What\u2019s the worst part about filling them out? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m busy. I have a lot to do. If my life fills up with meaningless tasks, I\u2019ll never get anything done. Therapist:\u2002 I can see you feel pretty irritated. How long does it take to fill out these forms? Patient:\u2002 .\u2009.\u2009. I \u00addon\u2019t know. A few minutes, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 I know some of the items \u00addon\u2019t apply, but actually they save us time in the therapy session because I \u00addon\u2019t have to ask you lots of questions myself. Could we try to problem-solve and see where you could fit in the time to do them? 128 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Patient:\u2002 I guess it\u2019s not that big a deal. I\u2019ll do them. I\u2019ll just leave work a little earlier next time. ",

Here I avoided directly evaluating the accuracy of the patient\u2019s automatic thoughts, because he is annoyed and I sense that he will per- ceive such questioning in a negative way. Instead I provide a rationale and help the patient realize that the task is not as time consuming as he has perceived it to be. In a third case, I judge that further persuasion to fill out forms will negatively affect a tenuous therapeutic alliance. Patient:\u2002 (in an angry voice) I hate these forms. They \u00addon\u2019t apply to me. I know you want me to fill them out, but I\u2019m telling you, they\u2019re worthless. Therapist:\u2002 Let\u2019s skip them, then, at least for the time being. I would like to get a clear idea of how \u00adyou\u2019ve been feeling during the week, though. Maybe you could just rate your emotions on a 0 to 100 or 0 to 10 scale. A different problem involves patients\u2019 difficulty in subjectively expressing their mood, either because they do not do so concisely, or because they have difficulty labeling their moods. You might gently interrupt, and either ask specific questions or demonstrate to them how to respond. Therapist:\u2002 Can I interrupt for a moment? Can you tell me in just a sentence how your mood has been this week as compared to last week? I do want to hear more about the problem with your brother in a few minutes, but first I just need to know whether \u00adyou\u2019ve gener- ally felt better, worse, or the same compared to last week. Patient:\u2002 A little worse, I think. Therapist:\u2002 More anxious? More sad? More angry? Patient:\u2002 Maybe a little more anxious. About the same amount of sad. Not angry really. When patients have difficulty labeling their moods, you might respond differently: Therapist:\u2002 It sounds like it\u2019s hard to pin down how \u00adyou\u2019ve been feel- ing. Maybe we should put on the agenda \u201cidentifying feelings.\u201d During the session, you might use the techniques described in Chapter 10 to teach patients to specify their mood.  Problems with Structuring the Session 129 Brief Update A common difficulty arises when patients provide too detailed an account of or unfocused rambling about their week. After several such sentences, you should gently jump in: Therapist:\u2002 Can I interrupt you for a moment? Right now, I just need to get the big picture of how \u00adyou\u2019ve been feeling. ",

After several such sentences, you should gently jump in: Therapist:\u2002 Can I interrupt you for a moment? Right now, I just need to get the big picture of how \u00adyou\u2019ve been feeling. Could you just tell me about your week in two or three sentences? Was it generally a good week? A bad week? Or did it have its ups and downs? If patients continue to offer details instead of the broader picture, you might demonstrate what you are looking for: Therapist:\u2002 It sounds to me like you\u2019re saying, \u201cI had a pretty hard week.\u00a0I had a fight with a friend, and I was really anxious about going out, and I had trouble concentrating on my work.\u201d Is that right? Some patients do understand and are capable of providing a con- cise review, but do not choose to do so. If you have data to suggest that questioning patients about their reluctance to comply could damage the alliance, you may initially allow them to control the update por- tion of the session. (Such data might include patients\u2019 verbal and/or nonverbal reactions to your prior attempts at structuring, their direct statements of strong preferences in the therapeutic process, or their reports of a strong reaction in the past when they have perceived others as controlling or dominating.) Extreme reactions to structuring are not common, however. Usu- ally you can matter-of-factly elicit reasons for patients\u2019 reluctance, and then problem-solve. After asking patients to review their week more concisely and noting a negative shift in affect, you might ask, \u201cWhen I just asked you to give me the big picture, what went through your mind?\u201d Having identified patients\u2019 automatic thoughts, you might then (1) help them evaluate the validity of their thoughts, (2) use the down- ward arrow technique (see pages 206\u2013208) to uncover the meaning of their thoughts, and/or (3) make an empathic statement and move straight to problem solving, as below: Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019m sorry you felt I cut you off again. I can see you have a lot on your mind, and I would like to hear it. Do you want to continue with the update now, or should we put \u201cupdate of week\u201d on the agenda? I just want to make sure I know all the problems you want to talk about today. 130 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND This latter choice is usually better than helping patients evalu- ate their thoughts at the moment if they are particularly annoyed.

By expressing your concern and willingness to compromise, you can often modify patients\u2019 perception that you are being too controlling. Bridge between Sessions A problem arises when patients provide too much or too little informa- tion. For example, when asked to relate important events in the preced- ing week, patients can give too detailed an account, necessitating gentle interruption by the therapist. Or they may shrug or say that they cannot think of anything, and you either need to ask a more pointed question (\u201cWhat happened when you went to see the professor?\u201d) or return to this question a little later on, if you have not collected the data you need. Patients may also have difficulty recalling the important points from the previous session, particularly if you neglected to send them home with therapy notes, or if they failed to read their notes for homework. Typical difficulties in setting the agenda arise when patients fail to contribute to the agenda, ramble when setting the agenda, or are hope- less about discussing problems on the agenda. Patients who fail to con- tribute to the agenda may be inadequately socialized (or too confused to name specific problems), or they may put a special negative meaning on contributing. These two cases are illustrated below. Therapist:\u2002 What problem or problems do you want my help in solving today? Patient:\u2002 .\u2009.\u2009. I \u00addon\u2019t know. Therapist:\u2002 What problems came up for you this past week? Or what problems do you expect might come up this week? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. Things are status quo, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 When did you feel worst this week? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks.) I \u00addon\u2019t know. The whole week was terrible.

Therapist:\u2002 How were you feeling when you were thinking about it? Annoyed? Patient:\u2002 Maybe a little. Therapist:\u2002 What was going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m just not sure that this therapy is right for me. Therapist:\u2002 It\u2019s good you told me that. Do you have a sense of what might help you more? Patient:\u2002 My last therapist just let me talk about whatever I wanted. He \u00addidn\u2019t make me decide at the beginning. Therapist:\u2002 So when I ask you to name problems you want help with, do you feel kind of hemmed in? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, I guess it does. Therapist:\u2002 So let\u2019s figure out together how to make it better. Would you like to skip setting the agenda at the very beginning of our ses- sions? How would it be if you came in and talked about whatever you want for the first 10 minutes? Then I\u2019d like to summarize what you said so I can make sure I really understood you. Then maybe we could pick something out from what \u00adyou\u2019ve said to focus on for the next part of the session. (pause) How does that sound? Patient:\u2002 It sounds better. Therapist:\u2002 Is there anything else that bothers you about this ther- apy? Patient:\u2002 No, I \u00addon\u2019t think so. Therapist:\u2002 Could you be sure to let me know if you think of some- thing? Patient:\u2002 Okay. This patient\u2019s response was unusual. Most patients are much more eas- ily socialized into agenda setting. ",

Most patients are much more eas- ily socialized into agenda setting. But in this case, I recognized that pushing the patient further might alienate him, so I demonstrated my desire to collaboratively \u201cfix\u201d the problem. He needed more flexibility 132 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND in session structure initially, but I moved him toward a more standard structure as soon as I could. Patients who ramble during agenda setting or launch into a detailed account of a problem instead of naming it usually just require further instruction. Therapist:\u2002 (gently interrupting) Can I interrupt you for a moment? Should we call this \u201cproblem with boss\u201d? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Can you tell me the name of any other problem you\u2019d like my help in solving? Patients who persist in the next session in describing problems rather than just naming them during agenda setting can be asked to jot down their agenda topics for homework (see Figure 7.1, page 102). A third problem in agenda setting arises when patients feel hope- less about discussing their problems. Here I try to get the patient into a problem-solving mode. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. So on the agenda so far, \u00adwe\u2019ve got the problems of tiredness, organizing your finances, and balancing your check- book. Anything else? Patient:\u2002 (sighs) No\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Yes\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I \u00addon\u2019t know\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019m so overwhelmed. I \u00addon\u2019t think any of this is going to help. Therapist:\u2002 You \u00addon\u2019t think talking about your problems in here will help? Patient:\u2002 No. What\u2019s the use? I mean, you \u00adcan\u2019t fix the fact that I owe too much money and I\u2019m so tired I \u00adcan\u2019t even get out of bed most mornings\u2014not to mention the fact that I\u2019m making so many mis- takes at work that I\u2019ll probably get fired. Therapist:\u2002 Well, it\u2019s true that we \u00adcan\u2019t fix everything at once. And you do have real problems that we need to work on together. Now, if we just have time to work on one thing today, which do you think will help more than the others? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. the tiredness, maybe. If I could sleep better, maybe I could get more done. ",

If I could sleep better, maybe I could get more done. In this case, I give the patient the message that his problems are real, that they can be worked on one by one, and that he need not work on them alone. Asking him to make a forced choice does help him focus on selecting a problem, and seems to help him get oriented toward prob-  Problems with Structuring the Session 133 lem solving. Had the patient refused to make a choice, I might have tried a different tactic: Therapist:\u2002 It sounds like you\u2019re feeling pretty hopeless. I \u00addon\u2019t know for sure that working together we can make a difference, but I\u2019d like to try. Would you be willing to try? Could we talk about the tiredness for a few minutes and see what happens? Acknowledging his hopelessness and my inability to guarantee success increased the patient\u2019s willingness to experiment with problem solv- ing. Review of Homework A typical problem arises when therapists, in their haste to get to patients\u2019 agenda issues, fail to ask patients about the homework they did over the past week. You are more likely to remember to ask about homework if you keep it as a standard agenda item and if you review your therapy notes from the previous session before patients enter your office. The opposite problem sometimes arises when the therapist reviews home- work (unrelated to the patient\u2019s distress that day) in too much detail before turning to the patient\u2019s agenda topics. Other homework prob- lems are discussed in detail in Chapter 17. Discussion of Agenda Items Typical problems here include hopelessness, unfocused or tangential discussion, inefficient pacing, and the failure to make a therapeutic intervention. Unfocused discussion usually results when you fail to struc- ture the discussion appropriately through gentle interruptions (guid- ing the patient back to the issue at hand); when you fail to emphasize key automatic thoughts, emotions, beliefs, and behaviors; and when you fail to summarize frequently. In the following transcript, I summarize several minutes of the patient\u2019s description in just a few words and redi- rect the patient to identify her automatic thoughts. Therapist:\u2002 Let me just make sure I understand. You had a fight with your sister yesterday. This reminded you of previous fights, and you began to get more and more angry. ",

Therapist:\u2002 Let me just make sure I understand. You had a fight with your sister yesterday. This reminded you of previous fights, and you began to get more and more angry. Last night you called her again, and she began to criticize you for not helping out with your mother. Is that right? 134 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 What went through your mind as she said, \u201cYou\u2019re the black sheep of the family\u201d? Pacing is often a problem when you overestimate how many issues can be discussed during one therapy session. It is preferable to priori- tize and then to specify two problems (or possibly a third) to be dis- cussed during a session, especially if you are a novice cognitive behavior therapist. Together you and the patient should keep track of the time, and collaboratively decide what to do if time is running short. In practi- cal terms, it is advisable to have two clocks (one for each of you to eas- ily see) so you can encourage patients to monitor the passage of time along with you: Therapist:\u2002 We only have 10 minutes left before we have to start finish- ing up the session. Would you like to continue talking about this problem with your neighbor, or finish up in the next minute or two so we have time to discuss the problem with your coworker? A third problem with discussion of problems is the therapist\u2019s failure to make a therapeutic intervention. Much of the time, merely describing a problem or identifying dysfunctional thoughts or beliefs related to the problem will not result in the patient\u2019s feeling better. You should be con- scious of your goal to help patients (during the session itself) respond to their dysfunctional cognitions, solve or partially solve a problem, and set up homework assignments designed to ameliorate the problem or help them feel less distressed. Throughout the session, you should ask yourself: \u201cHow can I help the patient feel better by the end of the session?\u201d \u201cHow can I help the patient have a better week?\u201d Setting New Homework Patients are less likely to do homework when the therapist: Suggests an assignment that is too difficult or is unrelated to the \u2022 patient\u2019s concerns. Fails to provide a good rationale. \u2022  Problems with Structuring the Session 135 Forgets to review homework assigned during previous sessions. \u2022 Does not stress the importance of daily homework in general and \u2022 of specific assignments.

Does not have the patient write down the homework assignment. \u2022 Noncollaboratively sets a homework assignment that the patient \u2022 does not want to do. If none of the above is true, you will try to ascertain whether patients hold dysfunctional beliefs about homework (e.g., \u201cI should feel better without working hard\u201d; \u201cMy therapist should cure me without my having to change things\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m too incompetent to do homework\u201d; \u201cHomework is trivial and \u00adwon\u2019t get me better\u201d). You then help patients specify and test their dysfunctional ideas about homework. Homework is discussed more extensively in Chapter 17. Final Summary You will periodically make summaries throughout the session to make sure you understand what patients have been expressing. If you have followed standard procedure and you have made sure the important points of the session are recorded as you go along, then the end sum- mary can consist of a quick review of these notes and a verbal summary of any other topics that were discussed and of the homework assign- ments. Without therapy notes to refer to, patients usually experience difficulty summarizing the session and remembering the important conclusions they drew. Feedback Problems arise when patients are distressed at the end of a session and you have not left sufficient time to resolve their distress, or when patients are upset but fail to relate their distress to you. A practical solution to avoid running out of time is to start closing down the ses- sion 5\u201310 minutes before the end. You can then more effectively review homework already assigned, discuss whether any other assignments 136 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND might be helpful, summarize the session or ask patients to do so, and elicit and respond to feedback. A sample response to negative feedback follows: Therapist:\u2002 What did you think about today\u2019s session? Was there any- thing I got wrong? Or did I say anything that bothered you? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t think you realize how hard it is for me to get things done. I have so many responsibilities and so many problems. ",

It\u2019s easy for you to say I should just concentrate on my work and forget all about what\u2019s happening with my boss. Therapist:\u2002 Oh, it\u2019s good you told me\u2014and I\u2019m sorry you got that impression. What I meant to get across was that I realize you are very distressed by the problem with your boss. I wish we had time to talk about that problem now. (pause) But meanwhile, was there something I said or did that made you think I was suggesting that you just forget all about the problem with your boss? Next, I clarified the misunderstanding, and we agreed to put the prob- lem on the agenda at our next session. Therapists at all levels of experience encounter difficulties in struc- turing with particular patients. Careful review of your session tapes can be invaluable in identifying and then solving these problems. A more extensive account of how to conceptualize and modify problems patients present in session can be found in J. S. Beck (2005).  137 Chapter 9 IDENTIfYING AUTOmATIC THOUGHTS T he cognitive model states that the interpretation of a situation (rather than the situation itself), often expressed in automatic thoughts, infl uences one\u2019s subsequent emotion, behavior, and physio- logical response. Of course, certain events are almost universally upset- ting: for example, a personal assault or rejection. People with psycho- logical disorders, however, often misconstrue neutral or even positive situations, and thus their automatic thoughts are biased. By critically examining their thoughts and correcting thinking errors, they often feel better. This chapter describes the characteristics of automatic thoughts. Then it describes how to: Explain automatic thoughts to patients. \u2022 Elicit and specify automatic thoughts. \u2022 Teach patients to identify automatic thoughts. \u2022 CHARACTERISTICS Of AUTOmATIC THOUGHTS Automatic thoughts are a stream of thinking that coexists with a more manifest stream of thought (Beck, 1964). These thoughts are not pecu- 138 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND liar to people with psychological distress; they are an experience com- mon to us all. Most of the time we are barely aware of these thoughts, although with just a little training we can easily bring these thoughts into consciousness. When we become aware of our thoughts, we may automatically do a reality check if we are not suffering from psychologi- cal dysfunction. ",

Most of the time we are barely aware of these thoughts, although with just a little training we can easily bring these thoughts into consciousness. When we become aware of our thoughts, we may automatically do a reality check if we are not suffering from psychologi- cal dysfunction. A reader of this text, for example, while focusing on the content of this chapter, may have the automatic thought, \u201cI \u00addon\u2019t understand this,\u201d and feel slightly anxious. He may, however, spontaneously (i.e., without conscious awareness) respond to the thought in a productive way: \u201cI do understand some of it; let me just reread this section.\u201d This kind of automatic reality testing and responding to negative thoughts is a common experience. People who are in distress, however, may not engage in this kind of critical examination. Cognitive behavior therapy teaches them tools to evaluate their thoughts in a conscious, structured way, especially when they are upset. Sally, for example, when she is reading an Economics chapter, has the same thought as the reader above: \u201cI \u00addon\u2019t understand this.\u201d Her thinking becomes more extreme, however: \u201cAnd I\u2019ll never understand it.\u201d She accepts these thoughts as correct and feels quite sad. After learning tools of cognitive behavior therapy, however, she is able to use her nega- tive emotion as a cue to look for, identify, and evaluate her thoughts, and develop an adaptive response: \u201cWait a minute, it\u2019s not necessarily true that I\u2019ll never understand this. I am having some trouble now. But if I reread it or come back to it when I\u2019m fresher, I may understand it more. Anyway, understanding it \u00adisn\u2019t crucial to my survival, and I can ask someone else to explain it to me if need be.\u201d Although automatic thoughts seem to pop up spontaneously, they become fairly predictable once the patient\u2019s underlying beliefs are identified. You are concerned with identifying those thoughts that are dysfunctional\u2014that is, those that distort reality, are emotionally dis- tressing, and/or interfere with patients\u2019 ability to reach their goals. Dys- functional automatic thoughts are almost always negative unless the patient is manic or hypomanic, has a narcissistic personality, or is a substance abuser. Automatic thoughts are usually quite brief, and patients are often more aware of the emotion they feel as a result of their thoughts than of the thoughts themselves. Sitting in session, for example, patients may be somewhat aware of feeling anxious, sad, irritated, or embarrassed, but unaware of their automatic thoughts until their therapist questions them. The emotions patients feel are logically connected to the content of their automatic thoughts. For example, a patient thinks, \u201cI\u2019m such a dope. ",

I \u00addon\u2019t really understand what everyone [at the meeting] is  Identifying Automatic Thoughts 139 saying,\u201d and feels sad. Another time he thinks, \u201cShe [my wife] \u00addoesn\u2019t appreciate me,\u201d and feels angry. When he has the thoughts, \u201cWhat if my loan \u00addoesn\u2019t go through? What will I do next?\u201d the patient feels anxious. Automatic thoughts are often in \u201cshorthand\u201d form, but can be eas- ily spelled out when you ask for the meaning of the thought. For exam- ple, when a patient had the thought, \u201cOh, no!\u201d the meaning was, \u201c[My boss] is going to give me too much work.\u201d \u201cDamn!\u201d for another patient was the expression of the idea, \u201cI was stupid to leave my cell phone at home.\u201d Automatic thoughts may be in verbal form, visual form (images), or both. In addition to his verbal automatic thought (\u201cOh, no!\u201d), the patient above had an image of himself, alone at his desk late at night, toiling over taxes (see Chapter 16 for a description of automatic thoughts in imaginal form). Automatic thoughts can be evaluated according to their validity and their utility. The most common type of automatic thought is dis- torted in some way and occurs despite objective evidence to the con- trary. A second type of automatic thought is accurate, but the conclusion the patient draws may be distorted. For example, \u201cI \u00addidn\u2019t do what I promised [a friend]\u201d is a valid thought, but the conclusion, \u201cTherefore I\u2019m a bad person,\u201d is not. A third type of automatic thought is also valid, but decidedly dys- functional. For example, Sally was studying for an exam and thought, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take me hours to finish this. I\u2019ll be up until 3:00 A.M.\u201d This thought was undoubtedly accurate, but it increased her anxiety and decreased her concentration and motivation. A reasonable response to this thought would address its utility: \u201cIt\u2019s true it will take a long time to finish this, but I can do it; \u00adI\u2019ve done it before. Dwelling on how long it will take makes me feel miserable, and I \u00adwon\u2019t concentrate as well. It\u2019ll probably take even longer to finish. It would be better to concentrate on finishing one part at a time and giving myself credit for having fin- ished it.\u201d Evaluating the validity and/or utility of automatic thoughts and adaptively responding to them generally produces a positive shift in affect.

To summarize, automatic thoughts coexist with a more manifest stream of thoughts, arise spontaneously, and are not based on reflection or deliberation. People are usually more aware of the associated emo- tion but, with a little training, they can become aware of their thinking. The thoughts relevant to personal problems are associated with specific emotions, depending on their content and meaning. They are often brief and fleeting, in shorthand form, and may occur in verbal and/or imaginal form. People usually accept their automatic thoughts as true, without reflection or evaluation. Identifying, evaluating, and respond- 140 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND ing to automatic thoughts (in a more adaptive way) usually produces a positive shift in affect. Explaining Automatic Thoughts to Patients It is desirable to explain automatic thoughts by using the patient\u2019s own examples. In the context of discussing a specific problem with a patient, you will elicit the automatic thoughts associated with the problem. Therapist:\u2002 [moving to the first agenda topic] Should we talk about how upset you were at the park yesterday? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 How were you feeling emotionally: Sad? Anxious? Angry? Patient:\u2002 Sad. Therapist:\u2002 What was going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 [further describing the situation instead of relating her auto- matic thoughts] I was looking at the people in the park, hanging out, playing Frisbee, things like that. Therapist:\u2002 What was going through your mind when you saw them? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019ll never be like them. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. [providing psychoeducation] You just identified what we call an automatic thought. Everyone has them. They are thoughts that just seem to pop into our heads. We\u2019re not deliberately try- ing to think about them; that\u2019s why we call them automatic. Most of the time, they\u2019re very quick and we\u2019re much more aware of the emotion\u2014in this case, sadness\u2014than we are of the thoughts. Lots of times the thoughts are distorted in some way. But we react as if they\u2019re true. Patient:\u2002 Hmmm.

Later in the session, I use Socratic questioning (see Chapter  Identifying Automatic Thoughts 141 11) to examine the thought with the patient so she can develop her own adaptive response. In the next part, I write down the automatic thought, emphasizing the cognitive model. Situation: Looking at people at the park \uf090 Automatic thought: \u201cI\u2019ll never be like them.\u201d \uf090 Emotion: Sad Therapist:\u2002 Let\u2019s get that down on paper. When you have the thought, \u201cI\u2019ll never be like them,\u201d you feel sad. Do you see how what you\u2019re thinking influences how you feel? Patient:\u2002 Uh-huh. Therapist:\u2002 That\u2019s what we call the cognitive model. What we\u2019ll do in therapy is teach you to identify your automatic thoughts when you notice your mood changing. That\u2019s the first step. We\u2019ll keep practic- ing it until it\u2019s easy. Then you\u2019ll learn how to evaluate your thoughts and change your thinking if it\u2019s not completely right. Is that clear? Patient:\u2002 I think so. Therapist:\u2002 [checking on the patient\u2019s understanding] Could you tell me in your own words about the relationship between thoughts and feelings? Patient:\u2002 Sometimes I have thoughts that are wrong and these thoughts make me feel bad\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. But what if the thoughts are right? Therapist:\u2002 Good point. Then we\u2019ll do some problem solving or find out what\u2019s so bad about it if they are right. My guess, though, is that we\u2019ll find a lot of mistakes in your thinking because you are depressed. Unrealistically negative thinking is always part of depres- sion. In any case, we\u2019ll figure out together whether your thoughts are right or wrong. At the end of this session, I check again to ascertain how well the patient seems to understand the cognitive model. Therapist:\u2002 To review a bit, could you tell me what you now understand about the relationship between thoughts and feelings? Patient:\u2002 Well, sometimes automatic thoughts just pop into my head and I accept them as true. And then I feel\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. ",

How about for homework this week if you look for some of these automatic thoughts? Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 Why do you think I\u2019m suggesting this? Patient:\u2002 Because sometimes my thoughts \u00adaren\u2019t true, and if I can fig- ure out what I\u2019m thinking, I can change it around and feel better. Therapist:\u2002 That\u2019s right. Okay, let\u2019s write this assignment down: When- ever I notice a change in mood or my mood is getting worse, ask myself\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Do you remember the question? Patient:\u2002 What was just going through my mind? Therapist:\u2002 Good! Get that down. Eliciting Automatic Thoughts The skill of learning to identify automatic thoughts is analogous to learning any other skill. Some patients (and therapists) catch on quite easily and quickly. Others need much more guidance and practice to identify automatic thoughts and images. The basic question you will ask is: \u201cWhat was going through your mind?\u201d You will ask this question: When patients describe a problematic situation that arose, usu- \u2022 ally since your previous session together, or When you notice a shift to, or intensification of, negative affect \u2022 during a session. This latter situation is often important and it is vital to be alert to both verbal and nonverbal cues from the patient, so as to be able to elicit their \u201chot cognitions\u201d\u2014that is, important automatic thoughts and images that arise in the therapy session itself, and are associated with a change or increase in emotion. These hot cognitions may be about the patient herself (\u201cI\u2019m such a failure\u201d), the therapist (\u201cShe \u00addoesn\u2019t under- stand me\u201d), or the subject under discussion (\u201cIt\u2019s not fair that I have so much to do\u201d) and may undermine the patient\u2019s motivation or sense of adequacy or worth. They may interfere with the patient\u2019s concentra- tion in session. Finally, they may interfere with the therapeutic relation-  Identifying Automatic Thoughts 143 ship. Identifying automatic thoughts on the spot gives the patient the opportunity to test and respond to the thoughts immediately, so as to facilitate the work in the rest of the session. How do you know when patients have experienced an affect shift? You are on the alert for nonverbal cues such as changes in facial expres- sion, tightening of muscles, shifts in posture, or hand gestures. ",

How do you know when patients have experienced an affect shift? You are on the alert for nonverbal cues such as changes in facial expres- sion, tightening of muscles, shifts in posture, or hand gestures. Verbal cues include change in tone, pitch, volume, or pace. Having noticed a change, you infer an affect shift and check it out by asking patients what just went through their mind. Difficulties in Eliciting Automatic Thoughts If patients are unable to answer the question \u201cWhat was just going through your mind?\u201d you can: 1.\t Ask them how they are/were feeling and where in their body they experienced the emotion. 2.\t Elicit a detailed description of the problematic situation. 3.\t Request that the patient visualize the distressing situation. 4.\t Suggest that the patient role-play the specific interaction with you (if the distressing situation was interpersonal). 5.\t Elicit an image. 6.\t Supply thoughts opposite to the ones you hypothesize actually went through their minds. 7.\t Ask for the meaning of the situation. 8.\t Phrase the question differently. These techniques are illustrated in the transcripts below. Heightening the Emotional and Physiological Response Therapist:\u2002 Sally, when you were thinking about volunteering in class, what was just going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure. Therapist:\u2002 How were you feeling? Patient:\u2002 Anxious, I think. Therapist:\u2002 Where did you feel the anxiety? Patient:\u2002 Here (pointing to her abdomen). In the pit of my stomach. Therapist:\u2002 Can you feel the same feeling now? 144 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Patient:\u2002 (Nods.) Therapist:\u2002 So you\u2019re sitting in class, thinking about volunteering, and you feel that anxiety in the pit of your stomach\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. What\u2019s going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 If I say something, it \u00adwon\u2019t come out right. People will judge me. Eliciting a Detailed Description Therapist:\u2002 So, you were alone in your room last night and you began feeling really upset? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 What was going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. I was just feeling so down, sad. Therapist:\u2002 Can you describe the scene for me? What time was it? Were you alone? What were you doing? What else was going on? Patient:\u2002 It was about 6:15. I had just gotten back from dinner. The dorm was pretty empty because I ate early. I was about to get my books out of my backpack so I could do my Chem homework\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. ",

Patient:\u2002 [expressing her automatic thoughts] This is just too hard. I\u2019ll never understand it. Therapist:\u2002 And then what happened? Patient:\u2002 I just lay down on my bed. Therapist:\u2002 And as you were lying there, what was going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t want to do this. I \u00addon\u2019t want to be here. Visualizing the Situation Therapist:\u2002 Sally, can you imagine that you\u2019re back in the class right now, the professor is talking, the student next to you is whispering, you\u2019re feeling nervous\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Can you visualize it, as if it\u2019s happening right now? How big is the class? Where are you sitting? What is the professor saying? What are you doing? And so on. Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m in my Economics class. The professor is standing in front of the class. Let\u2019s see, [shifting to past tense, which makes the expe- rience less immediate and decreases the emotional response] I was sitting about three-quarters of the way back, I was listening pretty hard\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009.  Identifying Automatic Thoughts 145 Therapist:\u2002 [guiding the patient to speak as if it\u2019s happening right at the moment] So, \u201cI\u2019m sitting three-quarters of the way back, I\u2019m listening pretty hard\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009.\u201d Patient:\u2002 She\u2019s saying something about what topics we can choose, a macroeconomic view of the economy or\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. something, and then this guy on my left leans over and whispers, \u201cWhen\u2019s the paper due?\u201d Therapist:\u2002 And what\u2019s going through your mind right now? Patient:\u2002 What did she say? What did I miss? Now I \u00adwon\u2019t know what to do. Re-Creating an Interpersonal Situation through Role Play Patients describe who said what verbally, then patients play themselves while you play the other person in the interaction. Therapist:\u2002 So, you were feeling down as you were talking to your class- mate about the assignment? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 What was going through your mind as you were talking to her? Patient:\u2002 (Pauses.)\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I \u00addon\u2019t know. I was just really down. Therapist:\u2002 Can you tell me what you said to her and what she said to you? Patient:\u2002 (Describes verbal exchange.) Therapist:\u2002 How about if we try a role play? I\u2019ll be the classmate and you be you. Patient:\u2002 Okay. ",

Therapist:\u2002 Sure, but can you call me later? \u00adI\u2019ve got to run to my next class. Patient:\u2002 It\u2019s fast. I just missed part of what Dr. Smith said about our paper. Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019m really in a hurry now. Call me after 7 o\u2019clock, okay? Bye\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Okay, out of role play. Were you aware of what was going through your mind? 146 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Patient:\u2002 Yeah. I was thinking that she was too busy for me, that she \u00addidn\u2019t really want to help me, and I \u00adwouldn\u2019t know what to do. Therapist:\u2002 You had the thoughts, \u201cShe\u2019s too busy for me,\u201d \u201cShe \u00addoesn\u2019t really want to help me,\u201d \u201cI \u00adwon\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 And those thoughts made you feel sad? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Eliciting an Image Therapist:\u2002 So, when I asked, \u201cHow\u2019s school going?\u201d you felt sad. What was going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 I think I was thinking about my Economics class, getting my paper back. Therapist:\u2002 Did you imagine that? Did you have an image in your mind? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. I pictured a \u201cC\u201d at the top, in red ink. Suggesting an Opposite Thought Therapist:\u2002 So when you were sitting alone in your room, were you thinking how great everything is going? Patient:\u2002 No, not at all! I was thinking that I \u00addon\u2019t know whether I belong here. Uncovering the Meaning of the Situation Therapist:\u2002 What did it mean to you that you got a B\u2013 on your paper? Patient:\u2002 That I\u2019m not smart enough. I \u00addon\u2019t have what it takes. Phrasing the Question Differently Therapist:\u2002 So when your mom \u00addidn\u2019t call you back, what were you thinking? Were you making a prediction? Were you remembering something? It is also possible, though usually less desirable, to ask patients, \u201cWhat do you guess what you were thinking?\u201d or \u201cCould you have been think- ing about \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003  or \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 ?\u201d because patients may spec- ulate inaccurately. Sometimes, however, these two questions are effec- tive.

Identifying Automatic Thoughts 147 You will try one or more of the techniques above when patients have difficulty identifying their automatic thoughts. But if they still experience difficulty, you might collaboratively decide to change the subject, to avoid patients\u2019 feeling that they are being interrogated, or to reduce the possibility of their viewing themselves as a failure: Therapist:\u2002 Well, sometimes these thoughts are hard to catch. No big deal. How about if we move on to \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 . Identifying Additional Automatic Thoughts It is important to continue questioning patients even after they report an initial automatic thought. Additional questioning may bring to light other important thoughts. Therapist:\u2002 So when you got the test back, you thought, \u201cI should have done better. I should have studied harder.\u201d What else went through your mind? Patient:\u2002 Everyone else probably did better than I did. Therapist:\u2002 Then what? Patient:\u2002 I was thinking, \u201cI \u00adshouldn\u2019t even be here. I\u2019m such a failure.\u201d You should be aware that patients may, in addition, have other automatic thoughts not about the same situation itself, but about their reaction to that situation. They may perceive their emotion, behavior, or physiological reaction in a negative way. Therapist:\u2002 So you had the thought, \u201cI might embarrass myself,\u201d and you felt anxious? Then what happened? Patient:\u2002 My heart started beating real fast and I thought, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Therapist:\u2002 And you felt.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009? Patient:\u2002 More anxious. Therapist:\u2002 And then? Patient:\u2002 I thought, \u201cI\u2019ll never feel okay.\u201d Therapist:\u2002 And you felt.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009? Patient:\u2002 Sad and hopeless. Therapist:\u2002 And then.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009? Patient:\u2002 I felt so bad I thought I \u00adwouldn\u2019t be much fun at lunch with Allison so I told her I \u00adwasn\u2019t feeling well and just went back to my room. 148 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Note that the patient first had automatic thoughts about a specific situation (volunteering in class). Then she had thoughts about her anxiety and her bodily reaction. In many cases, these secondary emo- tional reactions can be quite distressing, and significantly compound an already upsetting situation. Then Sally made a negative prediction that affected her behavior. To work most efficiently, it is important to determine at which point patients were most distressed (before, during, or after a given incident), and what their automatic thoughts were at that point.

To work most efficiently, it is important to determine at which point patients were most distressed (before, during, or after a given incident), and what their automatic thoughts were at that point. Patients may have had distressing automatic thoughts: Before \u2022 a situation, in anticipation of what might happen (\u201cWhat if she yells at me?\u201d), During \u2022 a situation (\u201cShe thinks I\u2019m stupid\u201d), and/or After \u2022 a situation, reflecting on what had happened (\u201cI\u00a0\u00adcan\u2019t do anything right; I never should have tried\u201d). Identifying the Problematic Situation Sometimes, in addition to being unable to identify automatic thoughts associated with a given emotion, patients have difficulty even identify- ing a particular situation or issue that is most troublesome to them (or which part is the most upsetting). When this happens, you can help them pinpoint the most problematic situation by proposing a number of upsetting problems, asking them to hypothetically eliminate one problem, and determining how much relief the patient feels. Once a specific situation has been identified, the automatic thoughts are more easily uncovered. Therapist:\u2002 [summarizing] So, \u00adyou\u2019ve been very upset for the past few days and you\u2019re not sure why, and you\u2019re having trouble identifying your thoughts\u2014you just feel upset most of the time. Is that right? Patient:\u2002 Yes. I just \u00addon\u2019t know why \u00adI\u2019ve been so upset all the time. Therapist:\u2002 What kinds of things have you been thinking about? Patient:\u2002 Well, school for one. And I\u2019m not getting along well with my roommate. And then I tried to get hold of my mother again and I \u00adcouldn\u2019t reach her, and, I \u00addon\u2019t know, just everything. Therapist:\u2002 So, there is a problem with school, with your roommate, with reaching your mom\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. anything else?  Identifying Automatic Thoughts 149 Patient:\u2002 Yeah. I \u00adhaven\u2019t been feeling too well. I\u2019m afraid I might be getting sick. Therapist:\u2002 Which of these situations bothers you the most\u2014school, roommate, reaching your mom, feeling sick? Patient:\u2002 Oh, I \u00addon\u2019t know. I\u2019m worried about all of them. Therapist:\u2002 Let\u2019s jot these four things down. Now let\u2019s say hypotheti- cally we could completely eliminate the feeling sick problem. Let\u2019s say you now feel physically fine, how anxious are you now? Patient:\u2002 About the same. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. Say, hypothetically, you do reach your mom right away after therapy, and everything\u2019s fine with her. How do you feel now? Patient:\u2002 A little bit better. Not that much.

Patient:\u2002 Yeah. I think so. Therapist:\u2002 Now, just to make sure\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. If you still had the paper to do, but the roommate problem disappeared, how would you feel? Patient:\u2002 Not that good. I think it is the paper that\u2019s bothering me the most. Therapist:\u2002 In a moment, we\u2019ll focus on the school problem, but first I\u2019d like to review how we figured it out, so you\u2019ll be able to do it yourself in the future. Patient:\u2002 Well, you had me list all the things I was worried about, and pretend to solve them one by one. Therapist:\u2002 And then you were able to see which one would give you the most relief if it had been resolved. Patient:\u2002 Yeah. We then focus on the school problem, identifying and responding to automatic thoughts and doing some problem solving. 150 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND The same process can be used in helping the patient to determine which part of a seemingly overwhelming problem is most distressing. Therapist:\u2002 So \u00adyou\u2019ve been pretty upset about your roommate. What specifically has been bothering you? Patient:\u2002 Oh, I \u00addon\u2019t know. Everything. Therapist:\u2002 Can you name some things? Patient:\u2002 Well, she\u2019s been taking my food and not replacing it. Not in a malicious way, but it still bothers me. And she\u2019s got a boyfriend, and whenever she talks about him, it reminds me that I \u00addon\u2019t have one. And she\u2019s messy; she leaves stuff all around\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. And she\u2019s kind of inconsiderate. Sometimes she talks really loudly on her cell phone. Therapist:\u2002 Anything else? Patient:\u2002 Those are the major things. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, \u00adwe\u2019ve done this before. Let me read these back to you so you can figure out which one bothers you the most. If you \u00adcan\u2019t, we\u2019ll hypothetically eliminate them one by one, and see which one makes the biggest difference in how you feel. Okay? ",

Differentiating between Automatic Thoughts and\u00a0Interpretations When you ask for patients\u2019 automatic thoughts, you are seeking the actual words or images that have gone through their mind. Until they have learned to recognize these thoughts, many patients report inter- pretations, which may or may not reflect their actual thoughts. In the following transcript, I guide a patient in reporting her thoughts. Therapist:\u2002 When you saw that woman in the cafeteria, what went through your mind? Patient:\u2002 I think I was denying my real feelings. Therapist:\u2002 What were you actually thinking? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure what you mean. In this exchange, the patient reported an interpretation of what she was feeling and thinking. Below, I try again, by focusing on and heighten- ing her emotion. Therapist:\u2002 When you saw her, what emotion did you feel? Patient:\u2002 I think I was just denying my feelings. Therapist:\u2002 Uh-huh. What feelings were you denying?  Identifying Automatic Thoughts 151 Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure. Therapist:\u2002 [supplying an emotion opposite to the expected one to jog her recall] When you saw her, did you feel happy? Excited? Patient:\u2002 No, not at all. Therapist:\u2002 Can you remember walking into the cafeteria and seeing her? Can you picture that in your mind? Patient:\u2002 Uh-huh. Therapist:\u2002 What are you feeling? Patient:\u2002 Sad, I think. Therapist:\u2002 As you look at her, what goes through your mind? Patient:\u2002 [reporting an emotion and a physiological reaction, instead of an automatic thought] I feel really sad, an emptiness in the pit of my stomach. Therapist:\u2002 What\u2019s going through your mind now? Patient:\u2002 She\u2019s really smart. [automatic thought] I\u2019m nothing com- pared to her. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. Anything else? Patient:\u2002 No. I just walked over to the table and started talking to my friend. Specifying Automatic Thoughts Embedded in Discourse Patients need to learn to specify the actual words that go through their minds in order to evaluate them effectively. Following are some exam- ples of embedded thoughts versus actual words: Embedded expressions Actual automatic thoughts I guess I was wondering if he likes me. Does he like me? I \u00addon\u2019t know if going to the professor would be a waste of time. It\u2019ll probably be a waste of time if I go. I \u00adcouldn\u2019t get myself to start reading. I \u00adcan\u2019t do this. You gently lead patients to identify the actual words that went through their mind. ",

I \u00adcan\u2019t do this. You gently lead patients to identify the actual words that went through their mind. Therapist:\u2002 So when you turned bright red in class, what went through your mind? Patient:\u2002 I guess I was wondering if he thought I was strange. 152 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 Can you recall the exact words you were thinking? Patient:\u2002 (puzzled) I\u2019m not sure what you mean. Therapist:\u2002 Were you thinking, \u201cI guess I was wondering if he thought I was strange,\u201d or were you thinking, \u201cDoes he think I\u2019m strange?\u201d Patient:\u2002 Oh, I see, the second one. Or actually I think it was, \u201cHe prob- ably thinks I\u2019m strange.\u201d Changing the Form of Telegraphic or Question Thoughts Patients often report thoughts that are not fully spelled out. As it is dif- ficult to evaluate such a telegraphic thought, you guide the patient to express the thought more fully. Therapist:\u2002 What went through your mind when the paper was announced? Patient:\u2002 \u201cUh-oh.\u201d I just thought, \u201cUh-oh.\u201d Therapist:\u2002 Can you spell the thought out? \u201cUh-oh\u201d means\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Patient:\u2002 I\u2019ll never get the work done in time. I have too much to do. If patients are unable to spell out their thought, you might try supplying an opposite thought: \u201cDid \u2018Uh-oh\u2019 mean, \u2018That\u2019s really good\u2019?\u201d Automatic thoughts are sometimes expressed in the form of a question, making evaluation difficult. Therefore, you guide patients in expressing their thoughts in a statement form prior to helping them evaluate it. Therapist:\u2002 So you felt anxious? What was going through your mind right then? Patient:\u2002 I was thinking, \u201cWill I pass the test?\u201d Therapist:\u2002 Okay. Were you thinking you probably would or \u00adwouldn\u2019t pass the test? Patient:\u2002 That I \u00adwouldn\u2019t. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. So can we rephrase your thought as, \u201cI might not pass the test\u201d? Another example follows: Therapist:\u2002 So you had the thought, \u201cWhat will happen to me [if I get more and more nervous]?\u201d What are you afraid could happen? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. lose control, I guess.

In the next example, the patient initially has difficulty identifying the fear behind her automatic thought. I try several different questions. Therapist:\u2002 So you thought, \u201cWhat next?\u201d What did you think would happen next? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. Therapist:\u2002 Were you afraid something specific might happen?

But a wide range of both external stimuli and internal experi- ences can give rise to automatic thoughts.

Identifying Automatic Thoughts 155 patients may have automatic thoughts in other categories, too. They can have thoughts about their cognitions (thoughts, images, beliefs, day- dreams, dreams, memories, or flashbacks), their emotions, their behav- ior, or their physiological or mental experiences. Any of these stimuli may engender an initial automatic thought (or series of automatic thoughts), followed by an initial emotional, behavioral, and/or physi- ological reaction. Patients may then have additional thoughts about any part of the cognitive model, leading to an additional associated emo- tional, behavioral, and/or physiological reaction (Figure\u00a09.2). Teaching Patients to Identify Automatic\u00a0Thoughts As described in Chapter 5, you can begin teaching patients the skill of identifying automatic thoughts even during the first session. Here I have just demonstrated the cognitive model, using Sally\u2019s own examples. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, when you notice your mood changing or getting worse in the next week, could you stop and ask yourself, \u201cWhat is going through my mind right now?\u201d Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 Maybe you could jot down a few of these thoughts on a piece of paper? Patient:\u2002 Sure. In later sessions, you might also explicitly teach the patient other techniques if the basic question (\u201cWhat\u2019s going through your mind right now?\u201d) is not effective. Therapist:\u2002 Sometimes you may not be able to tell what you were think- ing. So either at the time or later, you can try what we just did here in session. Replay the scene as vividly as you can in your imagina- tion, as if it\u2019s happening again, and concentrate on how you\u2019re feel- ing. Then ask yourself, \u201cWhat\u2019s going through my mind?\u201d Do you think you could do that? Or should we practice it again? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019ll give it a try. Again, if asking the basic questions and trying the imagery tech- nique are not sufficient, you might explicitly teach the patient to hypothesize about her thoughts. ",

This method is less desirable because it is more likely the patient will report a later interpretation instead of her actual thoughts at the time. 156 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 If you still have trouble figuring out what was going through your mind, here are some other questions [see Figure 9.3 you can ask yourself. Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 First question: If I had to, what would I guess I was thinking about? Or could I have been thinking about or \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 ? Or, was I imagining something or remembering something? Or, finally, what does this situation mean to me? Or you might try to figure out what the opposite thought might be to jog your memory. Patient:\u2002 Okay. TECHNIQUES TO ELICIT AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS Basic question: What was going through your mind just then? To identify automatic thoughts: 1. Ask this question when you notice a shift in (or intensification of) affect during a session. 2. Have the patient describe a problematic situation or a time during which she experienced an affect shift and ask the above question. 3. If needed, have the patient use imagery to describe the specific situation or time in detail (as if it is happening now) and then ask the above ques- tion. 4. If needed or desired, have the patient role-play a specific interaction with you and then ask the above question. Other questions to elicit automatic thoughts: 1. What do you guess you were thinking about? 2. Do you think you could have been thinking about _______ or ______? (Therapist provides a couple of plausible possibilities.) 3. Were you imagining something that might happen or remembering some- thing that did? 4. What did this situation mean to you? (Or say about you?) 5. Were you thinking ______? (Therapist provides a thought opposite to the expected response.) FIGURE 9.3.\u2002 Summary of techniques to identify automatic thoughts. From J. S. Beck (2011). Copyright 2011 by Judith S. Beck.

Patient:\u2002 Fine. To summarize, people with psychological disorders make predict- able errors in their thinking. You teach patients to identify their dys- functional thinking, then to evaluate and modify it. The process starts with the recognition of specific automatic thoughts in specific situa- tions. Identifying automatic thoughts is a skill that comes easily and naturally to some patients and is more difficult for others. You need to listen closely to ensure that patients report actual thoughts, and you may need to vary your questioning if patients do not readily identify their thoughts. The next chapter clarifies, among other things, the dif- ference between automatic thoughts and emotions.  158 Chapter 10 IDENTIfYING EmOTIONS E motions are of primary importance in cognitive behavior therapy. After all, the major goals of treatment are symptom relief (espe- cially a reduction in the patient\u2019s level of distress) and a remission of the patient\u2019s disorder. Intense negative emotion is painful and may be dysfunctional if it interferes with a patient\u2019s capacity to think clearly, solve problems, act effectively, or gain satisfaction. Patients with a psychiatric disorder often experience an intensity of emotion that can seem excessive or inappropriate to the situation. Sally, for example, felt enormous guilt and then sadness when she had to cancel a minor social event with her roommate. She was also extremely anxious about going to a professor for help. Yet the intensity and quality of patients\u2019 emotions make sense when you recognize the strength of their automatic thoughts and the beliefs (which are usually quite painful) that have become activated. It is important to acknowledge and empathize with how patients feel and refrain from challenging or disputing their emotions. Evaluate the thoughts and beliefs that underlie patients\u2019 distress to reduce their dysphoria; do not evaluate their emotions. You  won\u2019t discuss all situations in which patients feel dysphoric, though\u2014you will use your conceptualization of the patient to decide which problems are most important. Typically, the most important problems are those associated with high levels of distress. Problems in which patients seem to be having a \u201cnormal\u201d level of distress are usu- ally less important. The aim of cognitive behavior therapy is not to get  Identifying Emotions 159 rid of all distress; negative emotions are as much a part of the richness of life as positive emotions and serve as important a function as does physical pain, often alerting us to potential problems that may need to be addressed.

In addition, you will seek to increase patients\u2019 positive emotions through discussion (usually relatively brief) of their interests, positive events that occurred during the week, and positive memories. You will often suggest homework assignments aimed at increasing the number of activities in which the patient is likely to experience mastery and pleasure (see Chapter 6). This chapter explains how to: Differentiate automatic thoughts from emotions. \u2022 Distinguish among emotions. \u2022 Label emotions. \u2022 Rate the intensity of emotions. \u2022 Distinguishing Automatic Thoughts from\u00a0Emotions Many patients do not clearly understand the difference between their thoughts and their emotions. You will endeavor to make sense of the patients\u2019 experience and share your understanding with them. You will continually and subtly help patients view their experiences through the cognitive model. You will organize the material patients present into the categories of the cognitive model: situation, automatic thought, and reaction (i.e., emotion, behavior, and physiological response). Be alert to occasions when patients confuse their thoughts and emotions. At these times, based on the flow of the session, their goals, and the strength of the collaboration, you may decide to: Ignore the confusion, \u2022 Address it at the time (either subtly or explicitly), or \u2022 Address it later. \u2022 Most of the time, mislabeling a thought as a feeling is relatively unimportant in a given context, and you can make a subtle correction. 160 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 You mentioned when we set the agenda that you wanted to talk about the phone call you had with your brother? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. I called him a couple of nights ago and he sounded kind of distant. Therapist:\u2002 And how were you feeling emotionally? Patient:\u2002 I felt like he really \u00addidn\u2019t want to talk, like he \u00addidn\u2019t really care whether I had called or not. Therapist:\u2002 So when you had the thoughts, \u201cHe \u00addoesn\u2019t really want to talk. He \u00addoesn\u2019t really care that I called,\u201d how did you feel emotion- ally? Sad? Angry?

Therapist:\u2002 And your thoughts were, \u201cThis is no use. I\u2019ll never get bet- ter\u201d? Patient:\u2002 Yes.  Identifying Emotions 161 In the examples above, Sally initially labeled thoughts as feelings. At times, patients do the reverse: that is, they label an emotion as a thought. Therapist:\u2002 As you walked into your empty dorm room, Sally, what went through your mind? Patient:\u2002 I was sad, lonely, real down. Therapist:\u2002 So you felt sad and lonely and down. What thought or image made you feel that way? Importance of Distinguishing among Emotions You continuously conceptualize patients\u2019 problems, trying to understand their experience and point of view and how their underlying beliefs give rise to specific automatic thoughts in a specific situation, influencing their emotions and behavior. The connection among patients\u2019 thoughts, emotion, and behavior should make sense. You will investigate further when patients report an emotion that does not seem to match the content of their automatic thoughts, as in the transcript below. Therapist:\u2002 How did you feel when your mother \u00addidn\u2019t call you back right away? Patient:\u2002 I was sad. Therapist:\u2002 What was going through your mind? ",

Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019m a little confused because those sound more like anx- ious thoughts. Was there anything else going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure. Therapist:\u2002 How about if we have you imagine the scene? [helping the patient vividly recall the scene in imagery form] You said you were sitting by the phone, waiting for her call? Patient:\u2002 And then I thought, \u201cWhat if something happened? Maybe there\u2019s something wrong.\u201d Therapist:\u2002 What happens next? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m looking at the phone, and I get teary. Therapist:\u2002 What\u2019s going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 If anything happened to Mom, there would be no one left who cares. 162 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 \u201cThere would be no one left who cares.\u201d How does that thought make you feel? Patient:\u2002 Sad. Real sad. This interchange started with a discrepancy. I was alert and so was able to pick up an inconsistency between the content of the automatic thought and the emotion associated with it. I was then able to help Sally retrieve a key automatic thought by using imaginal recall. Had I cho- sen to focus on the anxious thoughts, I may have missed Sally\u2019s cen- tral concern. Although it may have been helpful to focus on a less cen- tral thought, finding and working with key automatic thoughts usually speeds up therapy. Difficulty in Labeling Emotions Most patients easily and correctly label their emotions. Some, how- ever, display a relatively impoverished vocabulary for emotions; others understand emotional labels intellectually but have difficulty labeling their own specific emotions. In either of these two cases, it is useful to have patients link their emotional reactions in specific situations to their labels. Devising an \u201cEmotion Chart\u201d such as the one in Figure 10.1 helps patients learn to label their emotions more effectively. Patients can list current or previous situations in which they felt a particular emotion and refer back to it whenever they are having difficulty nam- ing how they felt. Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes talking about different emotions so we can both understand better how you feel in differ- ent situations. Okay?

FIGURE 10.1.\u2002 Sample Emotion Chart.  Identifying Emotions 163 Patient:\u2002 Sure. Therapist:\u2002 Can you remember a time when you felt angry? Patient:\u2002 Uh, yeah\u00a0 .\u2009.\u2009. When my brother cancelled plans to see this movie; I forget which one, but I really wanted to go. Anyway, he told me he was going out with his friends instead\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Therapist:\u2002 And what was going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 Who does he think he is? I \u00adwouldn\u2019t do that to him. He should treat me better. Therapist:\u2002 And you felt\u2014 Patient:\u2002 Mad. Here I had the patient recall a specific event in which he felt a given emotion. From his description, it sounded as if he had correctly identi- fied his emotion. Because I wanted to make sure, I asked him to iden- tify his automatic thoughts. The content of the automatic thoughts did match his stated emotion. Next, I asked the patient to recall other occasions when he felt angry, sad, and anxious. Again I asked for his specific automatic thoughts in these situations to ensure he was accurately labeling his emotions. We then created the Emotion Chart (Figure 10.1). I asked the patient to refer to it in session and at home whenever he was having difficulty labeling what he was feeling. It is not necessary to use this technique to differentiate emotions with most patients. Others may benefit from a quick discussion along the above lines. A few might profit from a list of negative emotions (see Figure 10.2) and a brief discussion. Sad, down, lonely, unhappy Anxious, worried, fearful, scared, tense Angry, mad, irritated, annoyed Ashamed, embarrassed, humiliated Disappointed Jealous, envious Guilty Hurt Suspicious FIGURE 10.2.\u2002 Negative emotions. 164 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Rating Degrees of Emotion It is sometimes important for patients not only to identify their emo- tions, but also to quantify the degree of emotion they are experiencing.

Some have dysfunctional beliefs about experiencing emotion (Green- berg, 2002; Holland, 2003; Leahy, 2003)\u2014for example, believing that if they feel a small amount of distress, it will increase and become intol- erable. Learning to rate the intensity of emotions aids patients in test- ing this belief. In addition, you will assess whether questioning and adaptively responding to a thought or belief have been effective, so you can judge whether a cognition requires further intervention. Failure to do so may sometimes lead you to inaccurately conclude that an intervention has succeeded, and you may proceed to the next thought or problem pre- maturely. Or the opposite may happen\u2014you may continue discussing an automatic thought or belief, not realizing that the patient is no lon- ger significantly distressed by it. Finally, gauging the intensity of an emotion in a given situation helps you and the patient determine whether that situation warrants closer scrutiny. A situation that is relatively less emotionally laden may be less valuable to discuss than one that is more distressing to the patient, where important beliefs may have been activated. Most patients learn to judge the intensity of an emotion fairly eas- ily. Therapist:\u2002 How did you feel when your friend said, \u201cSorry, I \u00addon\u2019t have time now\u201d? Patient:\u2002 Pretty sad, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 If 100% is the saddest you ever felt or could imagine feel- ing, and 0% is completely not sad, how sad did you feel right when he said, \u201cSorry, I \u00addon\u2019t have time now\u201d? Patient:\u2002 About 75%. Some patients have difficulty with or \u00addon\u2019t like putting a specific number to the intensity. You can simply ask them to rate whether they experienced the emotion \u201ca little,\u201d \u201ca medium amount,\u201d \u201cvery,\u201d or \u201ccom- pletely.\u201d If even that is difficult, drawing a scale can help: Not sad at all A little sad Medium sad Very sad Completely sad (saddest I have been or could imagine being)  Identifying Emotions 165 Therapist:\u2002 How did you feel when your friend said, \u201cSorry, I \u00addon\u2019t have time now\u201d?

Therapist:\u2002 Okay, \u00adwe\u2019ve got our scale now. Let\u2019s see how useful it is. Were you sad any other times this week? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, last night when I locked myself out of my room. Therapist:\u2002 Use your new scale as a guide. About how sad did you feel? Patient:\u2002 Well, between a medium amount and very sad. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Now, do you think you could use this scale as a guide whenever you\u2019re trying to figure out how sad you are? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I can do that. Using Emotional Intensity to Guide Therapy Patients may not realize which situations they should bring up for dis- cussion. You can ask them to rate the degree of distress they are still experiencing to decide whether discussion of a given situation is likely to help. In the next transcript, I quickly realize that Sally and I will probably not accomplish much by focusing on an initial situation that she has described: Therapist:\u2002 So a problem you want to talk about has to do with your roommate? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 Did something come up this week? Patient:\u2002 Well, I felt bad when she went out with her boyfriend instead of me. Therapist:\u2002 How bad did you feel, 0 to 100%? 166 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. Maybe 25%? Therapist:\u2002 And now? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks.) Less. Therapist:\u2002 Sounds like this \u00adwasn\u2019t a terribly upsetting situation. Was there another time this week when you got pretty upset with her? In summary, you aim to obtain a clear picture of situations that are distressing to patients. You help them clearly differentiate their thoughts from their emotions. You empathize with their emotions throughout this process and help them evaluate the dysfunctional thinking that has influenced their mood.  167 Chapter 11 EVAlUATING AUTOmATIC THOUGHTS P atients have hundreds or thousands of thoughts a day, some dys- functional, some not.

Patients may have made a spontaneous utterance during a session (e.g., \u201cI just  don\u2019t think any- thing can help me\u201d); related an automatic thought, often from the past week; or reported an automatic thought they predict will arise in the future. Next you need to conceptualize whether this is an important 168 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND thought on which to focus; that is, is it currently distressing or dysfunc- tional or likely to recur? If it was an automatic thought from the past week, you might ask: \u201cIn what situation did you have this thought? How much did you believe it at the time? How much do you believe it now?\u201d \u201cHow did it make you feel emotionally? How intense was the emotion then? How intense is the emotion now?\u201d \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d You will also ask yourself whether the patient is likely to have this kind of thought again and be distressed by it. You will vary these questions slightly if the patient spontaneously uttered the thought and/or if the thought is related to a future situation. You also should find out whether additional thoughts were more central or distressing: \u201cWhat else went through your mind [in this situation]? Did you have any other thoughts or images?\u201d \u201cWhich thought/image was most upsetting?\u201d In the transcript below, I determine that Sally\u2019s automatic thought was important: Therapist:\u2002 [summarizing] So you were in class on Thursday, and you \u00addidn\u2019t know the answers to questions that your professor threw out to the class, and you felt really sad because you thought, \u201cI\u2019ll never make it here.\u201d How much did you believe that thought, and how sad did you feel? Patient:\u2002 I believed it a lot, and I felt really sad. Therapist:\u2002 How much do you believe it now, and how sad do you feel now? Patient:\u2002 I still think I \u00adwon\u2019t make it. Therapist:\u2002 And is the thought still distressing? Patient:\u2002 Very. This turned out to be an important automatic thought for us to evalu- ate. ",

In another case, though, Sally and I judged that a different auto- matic thought was probably not worth discussing. Sally was describing a  Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 169 problem she had had in the library, and I asked her a few questions to evaluate whether this was an important situation to discuss. Therapist:\u2002 [summarizing] So you were in the library and you \u00adcouldn\u2019t find the book you needed, and you thought, \u201cThey are so ineffi- cient. The system is so bad,\u201d and you felt frustrated. How frustrated did you feel? Patient:\u2002 Oh, like 90%. Therapist:\u2002 Are you still that frustrated? Patient:\u2002 No, I got over it. Therapist:\u2002 What did you do when you were frustrated? Patient:\u2002 I went back to my room and worked on my chemistry prob- lems instead. I ended up borrowing the book from Lisa. I have to give it back to her by Monday, though. Therapist:\u2002 So you solved the problem. Do you think the library could be a problem in the future? Might you get frustrated and leave, but not do something productive? Or not get the book you need another way? Patient:\u2002 I think I\u2019m all right. I know what to expect. If I \u00adhadn\u2019t gotten the book from Lisa, I would have gone back to the library later and asked for help. Therapist:\u2002 That\u2019s good\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Sounds like \u00adyou\u2019ve got a plan in case any- thing else comes up. Should we move on to something else? Here I judge that the automatic thought, while upsetting at the time, did not warrant further discussion because (1) Sally was no lon- ger distressed by it, (2) she had acted in a functional way, (3) the situa- tion was resolved, and (4) she had a good solution if the same problem recurred. Why do patients bring up problems and automatic thoughts that are not important? Most of the time, it is because they are simply not socialized enough to treatment.

Even if a patient reports an important automatic thought, you might decide not to focus on it, especially if: You judge that doing so might impair the therapeutic relationship \u2022 (e.g., you perceive that the patient is feeling invalidated). The patient\u2019s level of distress is too high to evaluate his thinking. \u2022 There\u2019s insufficient time in the session to help the patient respond \u2022 effectively to the thought. 170 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND You assess that it is more important to work on another element of \u2022 the cognitive model (e.g., you might focus instead on solving the problematic situation, teaching the patient emotional regulation techniques, discussing more adaptive behavioral responses, or addressing the patient\u2019s physiological response). You assess that it is more important to elicit and work on a \u2022 dysfunctional belief underlying the automatic thought. You assess that it is more important to discuss a different problem. \u2022 Questioning to Evaluate an\u00a0Automatic\u00a0Thought Having elicited an automatic thought, determined that it is important and distressing, and identified its accompanying reactions (emotional, physiological, and behavioral), you may collaboratively decide with the patient to evaluate it. You would rarely directly challenge the automatic thought, however, for three reasons. 1.\t You usually do not know in advance the degree to which any given automatic thought is distorted (e.g., Sally\u2019s thought that no one wanted to have dinner with her could have been valid). 2.\t A direct challenge can lead patients to feel invalidated (e.g., Sally might think, \u201c[My therapist] is telling me I\u2019m wrong\u201d). 3.\t Challenging a cognition violates a fundamental principal of cognitive behavior therapy, that of collaborative empiricism: You and the patient together examine the automatic thought, test its validity and/or utility, and develop a more adaptive response. It is also important to keep in mind that automatic thoughts are rarely completely erroneous. Usually, they contain at least a grain of truth (which is important that you acknowledge). Figure 11.1 contains a list of Socratic questions to help patients evaluate their thinking. (Actually, \u201cSocratic\u201d is a misnomer some of the time; the Socratic questioning method, derived from the philosopher Socrates, involves a dialectical discussion.) Patients need a structured method to evaluate their thinking; otherwise, their responses to auto- matic thoughts can be superficial and unconvincing and will fail to improve their mood or functioning.

The evaluation should be even- handed. You do not want patients, for example, to ignore evidence that  Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 171 supports an automatic thought, devise an alternative explanation that is not likely, or adopt an unrealistically positive view of what might hap- pen. It is important to relate to patients that not all of the questions in Figure 11.1 are suitable for every automatic thought. Moreover, using all of the questions, even if they logically apply, may be too cumbersome and time consuming. Patients may not evaluate their thoughts at all if they consider the process too burdensome. Usually you will introduce just one or a few questions at a time. You may use questioning from the very first session to evaluate a specific automatic thought. In a subsequent session, you will begin to explain the process more explicitly, so patients can learn to evaluate their thinking between sessions: Therapist:\u2002 (Summarizes past portion of the session; writes automatic thoughts on paper for both to see) So when you met your friend Karen on the way to the class, you had the thought, \u201cShe \u00addoesn\u2019t really care what happens to me,\u201d and that thought made you feel sad? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 And how much did you believe that thought at the time? Patient:\u2002 Oh, pretty much. About 90%. Therapist:\u2002 And how sad did you feel? Patient:\u2002 Maybe 80%. Therapist:\u2002 Do you remember what we said last week? Sometimes automatic thoughts are true, sometimes they turn out not to be true, and sometimes they have a grain of truth. Can we look at this thought about Karen now, and see how accurate it seems? Patient:\u2002 Okay. You can use any set of questions to help patients evaluate their thinking, but Figure 11.1 can be helpful as it guides you and the patient to: Examine the validity of the automatic thought. \u2022 Explore the possibility of other interpretations or viewpoints. \u2022 Decatastrophize the problematic situation. \u2022 Recognize the impact of believing the automatic thought. \u2022 Gain distance from the thought. \u2022 Take steps to solve the problem. \u2022 172 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Each of the questions is described below.

Patient:\u2002 Well, when we passed on Locust Walk, she seemed like she was real rushed. She just quickly said, \u201cHi, Sally, see you later,\u201d and kept going fast. She hardly even looked at me. Therapist:\u2002 Anything else? Patient:\u2002 Well, sometimes she\u2019s pretty busy and \u00addoesn\u2019t have much time for me. Therapist:\u2002 Anything else? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks.) No. I guess not. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, now is there any evidence on the other side, that maybe she does care about what happens to you? 1.\t What is the evidence that supports this idea?  What is the evidence against this idea? 2.\t Is there an alternative explanation or viewpoint? 3.\t What is the worst that could happen (if I\u2019m not already thinking the worst)? If it happened, how could I cope?  What is the best that could happen?  What is the most realistic outcome? 4.\t What is the effect of my believing the automatic thought?  What could be the effect of changing my thinking? 5.\t What would I tell \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003  [a specific friend or family member] if he or she were in the same situation? 6.\t What should I do? FIGURE 11.1.\u2002 Questioning automatic thoughts.  Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 173 Patient:\u2002 (answering in general terms) Well, she is pretty nice. \u00adWe\u2019ve been friends since school started. Therapist:\u2002 [helping Sally think more specifically] What kinds of things does she do or say that might show she likes you? Patient:\u2002 Ummm\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. she usually asks if I want to go get something to eat with her. Sometimes we stay up pretty late just talking about things. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. So, on the one hand, on this occasion yesterday, she rushed by you, not saying much. And there have been other times, too, when she\u2019s been pretty busy. But on the other hand, she asks you to eat with her, and you stay up late talking sometimes. Right? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Here I gently probed to uncover evidence regarding the validity of Sally\u2019s thought. Having elicited evidence on both sides, I summarized what Sally said. ",

Here I gently probed to uncover evidence regarding the validity of Sally\u2019s thought. Having elicited evidence on both sides, I summarized what Sally said. The \u201cAlternative Explanation\u201d Questions Below, I help Sally devise a reasonable alternative explanation for what has happened. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Now, let\u2019s look at the situation again. Could there be an alternative explanation for what happened, other than she \u00addoesn\u2019t care about what happens to you? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. Therapist:\u2002 Why else might she have rushed by quickly? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure. She might have had a class. She might have been late for something. The \u201cDecatastrophizing\u201d Questions Many patients predict a worst-case scenario. If a patient\u2019s automatic thought does not contain a catastrophe, it is often useful to ask the patients about their worst fear. In both cases, you should follow up by asking patients what they can do if the worst does happen. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. Now, what would be the worst that could happen in this situation? Patient:\u2002 That she would truly not like me, I guess. That I \u00adcouldn\u2019t count on her for support. 174 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 How could you cope with that? Patient:\u2002 Well, I \u00adwouldn\u2019t be happy about it. I guess I\u2019d have to stop counting on her friendship. Therapist:\u2002 [asking leading questions to help her develop a robust response] Do you have other friends you could count on? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 So you\u2019d be okay? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I would. Patients\u2019 worst fears are often unrealistic. Your objective is to help them think of more realistic outcomes, but many patients have diffi- culty doing so. You might help them extend their thinking by first ask- ing for the best outcome. Therapist:\u2002 Now the worst may be unlikely to happen. What\u2019s the best that could happen? Patient:\u2002 That she\u2019ll realize she cut me off. That she\u2019ll apologize. Therapist:\u2002 And what\u2019s the most realistic outcome? Patient:\u2002 That she really was busy and we\u2019ll continue to be friends. In the previous section, I help Sally see that even if the worst happened, she would cope. She also realizes that her worst fears are unlikely to come true. Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients\u2019 worst fears are that they will die? A:\t You obviously would not ask the \u201cHow would you cope?\u201d question. Instead you might ask for the best and most realistic outcomes. ",

You may also decide to explore what the worst part of dying would be: fears of the process of dying, fears of what they imagine an afterlife might be like for them, or fears of what would happen to loved ones after the patient\u2019s death. The \u201cImpact of the Automatic Thought\u201d Questions Below, I help Sally assess the consequences of responding and not responding to her distorted thinking. Therapist:\u2002 And what is the effect of your thinking that she \u00addoesn\u2019t like you? Patient:\u2002 It makes me sad. I think it kind of makes me withdraw from her.  Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 175 Therapist:\u2002 And what could be the effect of changing your thinking? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019d feel better. The \u201cDistancing\u201d Questions Patients often benefit from getting some distance from their thoughts by imagining what they would tell a close friend or family member in a similar situation. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, let\u2019s say your friend Allison had a friend who some- times was rushed, but seemed caring at other times. If Allison had the thought, \u201cMy friend \u00addoesn\u2019t care about me,\u201d what would you tell her? Patient:\u2002 I guess I\u2019d tell her not to put too much importance on the times she seemed rushed, especially if her friend was nice about it. Therapist:\u2002 Does that apply to you? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I guess it does. The \u201cProblem-Solving\u201d Questions The answer to this question may be cognitive and/or behavioral in nature. The cognitive part would entail having patients remember their responses to the questions. In Sally\u2019s case, we came up with a behavioral plan: Therapist:\u2002 And what do you think you should do about this situation? Patient:\u2002 Uh\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019m not sure what you mean. Therapist:\u2002 Well, have you withdrawn any since this happened yester- day? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, I think so. I \u00addidn\u2019t say much when I saw her this morn- ing. Therapist:\u2002 So this morning you were still acting as if that original thought were true. How could you act differently? Patient:\u2002 I could talk to her more, be friendlier myself. ",

Patient:\u2002 I could talk to her more, be friendlier myself. If I were unsure of Sally\u2019s social skills or motivation to carry through with this plan of being friendlier to Karen, I might have spent a few min- utes asking Sally such questions as \u201cWhen might you see her again?\u201d; \u201cWould it be worth it, do you think, to seek her out yourself?\u201d; \u201cWhat could you say to her when you do see her?\u201d; \u201cAnything you think could get in the way of your saying that?\u201d (If needed, I might have modeled what she could say to Karen, and/or engaged Sally in a role play.) 176 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Assessing the Outcome of\u00a0the\u00a0Evaluation\u00a0Process In the last part of this discussion, I assess how much Sally now believes the original automatic thought and how she feels emotionally, so I can decide what to do next in the session. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Now, how much do you believe this thought: \u201cKaren \u00addoesn\u2019t really care what happens to me\u201d? Patient:\u2002 Not very much. Maybe 20%. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. And how sad do you feel? Patient:\u2002 Not much either. Therapist:\u2002 Good. It sounds like this exercise was useful. Let\u2019s go back and see what we did that helped. You and the patient will not use all the questions in Figure 11.1 for every automatic thought you evaluate. Sometimes none of the questions seems useful, and you might take another tack altogether (see pages 178\u2013186). Conceptualizing Why the Evaluation of\u00a0an\u00a0Automatic Thought Was Ineffective If the patient still believes the automatic thought to a significant degree and does not feel better emotionally, you need to conceptualize why this initial attempt at cognitive restructuring has not been sufficiently effective. Common reasons to consider include the following: 1.\t There are other, more central automatic thoughts and/ or images left unidentified or unevaluated. 2.\t The evaluation of the automatic thought is implausible, superficial, or inadequate. 3.\t The patient has not sufficiently expressed the evidence that he or she believes supports the automatic thought. 4.\t The automatic thought itself is also a core belief. 5.\t The patient understands intellectually that the automatic thought is distorted, but does not believe it on an emotional level.  Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 177 In the first situation, the patient has not verbalized the most central automatic thought or image. ",

Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 177 In the first situation, the patient has not verbalized the most central automatic thought or image. John, for example, reports the thought, \u201cIf I try out [for the community basketball team], I probably \u00adwon\u2019t make it.\u201d Evaluating this thought does not significantly affect his dysphoria because he has other important (but unrecognized) thoughts: \u201cWhat if they think I\u2019m a lousy player?\u201d \u201cWhat if I make stupid mistakes?\u201d He also has an image of the coach and other players watching him with mocking, scornful faces. In a second situation, the patient responds to an automatic thought super- ficially. John thinks, \u201cI \u00adwon\u2019t finish all my work. I have too much to do.\u201d Instead of carefully evaluating the thought, John merely responds, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll probably get it done.\u201d This response is insufficient, and his anxiety does not decrease. In a third situation, the therapist does not thoroughly probe for, and there- fore the patient does not fully express the evidence that his or her automatic thought is true, resulting in an ineffective adaptive response, as seen here: Therapist:\u2002 Okay, John, what evidence do you have that your sister \u00addoesn\u2019t want to bother with you? Patient:\u2002 Well, she hardly ever calls me. I always call her. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, anything on the other side? That she does care about you, that she does want a good relationship with you? Had John\u2019s therapist queried him further, he would have uncov- ered other evidence that John has to support his automatic thought: that his sister spent more time with her girlfriends during vacations than with John, that she sounded impatient on the phone when he called, and that she had not sent him a birthday card. Having elicited this additional data, the therapist could have helped John weigh the evidence more effectively and investigated alternative explanations for his sister\u2019s behavior. In a fourth situation, the patient identifies an automatic thought that is also a core belief. John often thinks, \u201cI\u2019m incompetent.\u201d He believes this idea so strongly that a single evaluation does not alter his perception or the associated affect. His therapist needs to use many techniques over time to alter this belief (see Chapter 14). In a fifth situation, the patient indicates that he believes an adaptive response \u201cintellectually,\u201d in his mind, but not \u201cemotionally,\u201d in his heart, soul, or gut. He discounts the adaptive response. ",

He discounts the adaptive response. In this case, the therapist and patient need to explore an unarticulated belief that lies behind the automatic thought: 178 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 How much do you believe that it\u2019s not your fault if you get laid off? Patient:\u2002 Well, I can see it intellectually. Therapist:\u2002 But? Patient:\u2002 Even though I know the economy is bad, I still think I should be able to hold on to my job. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, let\u2019s assume for a moment that you do get laid off. What would be the worst part about that, or what would that mean? Here, John\u2019s therapist discovers that he does not really believe the adap- tive response and uncovers an assumption: If I lose my job, it means I\u2019m incompetent. To summarize, having evaluated an automatic thought, you ask patients to rate how much they believe the adaptive response and how they feel emotionally. If their belief is low and they are still distressed, you conceptualize why examining the thought did not alleviate their distress and plan a strategy for what to do next. Using Alternate Methods to Help Patients Examine Their Thinking In lieu of or in addition to using the questions in Figure 11.1, you can do the following: Vary your questions. \u2022 Identify the cognitive distortion. \u2022 Use self-disclosure. \u2022 These strategies are described below. Using Alternative Questions The following transcript is just one illustration of how to vary your ques- tions when you predict that standard questions will be ineffective. Therapist:\u2002 What went through your mind [when you asked your mom if it was all right with her to shorten your time together, and she sounded hurt and angry]? Patient:\u2002 That I should have known it was a bad time to call. I \u00adshouldn\u2019t have called.  Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 179 Therapist:\u2002 What\u2019s the evidence that you \u00adshouldn\u2019t have called? Patient:\u2002 Well, my mother is usually rushed in the morning. If I had waited until after she got home from work, she might have been in a better frame of mind. Therapist:\u2002 Had that occurred to you? Patient:\u2002 Well, yeah, but I wanted to let my friend know right away whether I could visit, so she could make plans. ",

Therapist:\u2002 So you actually had a reason for calling when you did, and it sounds as if you knew it might be risky, but you really wanted to let your friend know as soon as you could? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 Is it reasonable to be so hard on yourself for taking the risk? Patient:\u2002 No\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Therapist:\u2002 You \u00addon\u2019t sound convinced. How bad is it anyway, in the scheme of things, for your mom to feel hurt that you want to spend one week of your summer vacation with your friend? I followed up these questions with others: How hurt did your mother feel? How long did the hurt last at that level? How does she probably feel now? Is it possible for you to spare your mother hurt all the time? Can you possibly do what is good for you and not hurt your mother at all, given that she wants to spend as much time with you as she can? Is it desirable to have a goal of never hurting someone else\u2019s feelings? What would you have to give up yourself? The previous transcript demonstrates how to use nonstandard ques- tions to help patients adopt a more functional perspective. Although I started out questioning the validity of the thought, I shifted the empha- sis to the implicit underlying belief (which we had previously discussed in other contexts): \u201cIt\u2019s bad to hurt other people\u2019s feelings.\u201d At the end, I asked the patient an open-ended question (\u201cHow do you see the situa- tion now?\u201d) to see whether she needed more help in responding to her thoughts. Note that many questions I asked were a variation of Ques- tion 2 in Figure 11.1: \u201cIs there an alternative explanation [for why you called when you did and for why your mother was hurt, other than that you were bad and at fault]?\u201d Identifying Cognitive Distortions Patients tend to make consistent errors in their thinking. Often there is a systematic negative bias in the cognitive processing of patients who suffer from a psychiatric disorder (Beck, 1976). The most common 180 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND errors are presented in Figure 11.2 (see also Burns, 1980). It often helps to label distortions and to teach patients to do the same.

The most common 180 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND errors are presented in Figure 11.2 (see also Burns, 1980). It often helps to label distortions and to teach patients to do the same. You might make mental notes of a patient\u2019s common distortions and point out a specific distortion when you spot a pattern: Therapist:\u2002 Sally, this idea that you either get an \u201cA\u201d and you\u2019re a suc- cess, or you \u00addon\u2019t and you\u2019re a failure\u2014that\u2019s what we call all-or- nothing thinking. Does it seem familiar? I remember you also thought that either you understood everything in a chapter, or you were stupid. Do you think it could be helpful to watch out for this kind of thinking? You can also provide patients with a list of distortions, such as the one in Figure 11.2, if you judge that they will not be overwhelmed by it. At another session, I gave Sally the list, and together we identified her typical automatic thoughts and the distortions they represented. For example: Catastrophizing: \u201cI\u2019ll flunk out of school.\u201d All-or-nothing thinking: \u201cIf I \u00adcan\u2019t read the entire chapter, it\u2019s not worth reading any of it.\u201d Mind reading: \u201cMy roommate \u00addoesn\u2019t want to be bothered with me.\u201d Emotional reasoning: \u201cI feel so incompetent.\u201d Sally kept this list handy and often referred to it when she was evalu- ating her automatic thoughts. Doing so helped her gain additional dis- tance from her thinking and allowed her to believe more strongly that perhaps an automatic thought was not true, or not completely true. Using Self-Disclosure At times, you might use judicious self-disclosure instead of or in addi- tion to Socratic questioning or other methods, to demonstrate how you were able to change similar automatic thoughts that you had, as illus- trated below: Therapist:\u2002 You know, Sally, sometimes I have thoughts like yours: \u201cI have to make everyone happy.\u201d But then I remind myself that I have a responsibility to take care of myself, and that the world probably \u00adwon\u2019t end if someone is disappointed. (pause) Do you think that applies to you, too?  Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 181 Although some automatic thoughts are true, many are either untrue or have just a grain of truth. Typical mistakes in thinking include: 1.\t All-or-nothing thinking (also called black-and-white, polarized, or dichotomous thinking): You view a situation in only two categories instead of on a continuum.  Example: \u201cIf I\u2019m not a total success, I\u2019m a failure.\u201d 2.\t Catastrophizing (also called fortune-telling): You predict the future negatively without considering other, more likely outcomes.

Example: \u201cI\u2019ll be so upset, I \u00adwon\u2019t be able to function at all.\u201d 3.\t Disqualifying or discounting the positive: You unreasonably tell yourself that positive experiences, deeds, or qualities do not count.  Example: \u201cI did that project well, but that \u00addoesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m competent; I just got lucky.\u201d 4.\t Emotional reasoning: You think something must be true because you \u201cfeel\u201d (actually believe) it so strongly, ignoring or discounting evidence to the contrary.  Example: \u201cI know I do a lot of things okay at work, but I still feel like I\u2019m a failure.\u201d 5.\t Labeling: You put a fixed, global label on yourself or others without considering that the evidence might more reasonably lead to a less disastrous conclusion.  Example: \u201cI\u2019m a loser. He\u2019s no good.\u201d 6.\t Magnification/minimization: When you evaluate yourself, another person, or a situation, you unreasonably magnify the negative and/or minimize the positive.  Example: \u201cGetting a mediocre evaluation proves how inadequate I am. Getting high marks \u00addoesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m smart.\u201d 7.\t Mental filter (also called selective abstraction): You pay undue attention to one negative detail instead of seeing the whole picture.  Example: \u201cBecause I got one low rating on my evaluation [which also contained several high ratings] it means I\u2019m doing a lousy job.\u201d 8.\t Mind reading: You believe you know what others are thinking, failing to consider other, more likely possibilities.  Example: \u201cHe thinks that I \u00addon\u2019t know the first thing about this project.\u201d  (cont.) FIGURE 11.2.\u2002 Thinking errors. Adapted with permission from Aaron T.

Work on acceptance. \u2022 These strategies are described below. Focus on Problem Solving Not all problems can be solved, but if a patient\u2019s perception of a situa- tion appears to be valid, you might investigate whether the problem can be solved, at least to some degree. In the transcript below, Sally and I have evaluated her automatic thought, \u201cI\u2019m going to run out of money,\u201d and the evidence seems clear that this is a valid perception. 9.\t Overgeneralization: You make a sweeping negative conclusion that goes far beyond the current situation.  Example: \u201c[Because I felt uncomfortable at the meeting] I \u00addon\u2019t have what it takes to make friends.\u201d 10.\t Personalization: You believe others are behaving negatively because of you, without considering more plausible explanations for their behavior.  Example: \u201cThe repairman was curt to me because I did something wrong.\u201d 11.\t \u201cShould\u201d and \u201cmust\u201d statements (also called imperatives): You have a precise, fixed idea of how you or others should behave, and you overestimate how bad it is that these expectations are not met.  Example: \u201cIt\u2019s terrible that I made a mistake. I should always do my best.\u201d 12.\t Tunnel vision: You only see the negative aspects of a situation.  Example: \u201cMy son\u2019s teacher \u00adcan\u2019t do anything right. He\u2019s critical and insensitive and lousy at teaching.\u201d FIGURE 11.2.\u2002 (cont.)  Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 183 Therapist:\u2002 So even if you\u2019re careful, it looks as if you \u00adwon\u2019t be able to come up with rent toward the end of the school year\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Have you already tried to do something about this? Patient:\u2002 No, not really. I \u00addon\u2019t want to ask my parents for more. They\u2019re pretty strapped as it is. Therapist:\u2002 But you might be able to use them as a last resort? Patient:\u2002 Maybe\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Therapist:\u2002 Have you thought of anything else? Patient:\u2002 No, I \u00addon\u2019t think there\u2019s anything else I can do. Therapist:\u2002 Have you talked to the dean of students? Patient:\u2002 I \u00adhadn\u2019t thought of that. Therapist:\u2002 Quite possibly he could help. I imagine there are other stu- dents who are also struggling financially. He might suggest another student loan, or a payment plan, or maybe there\u2019s some emergency fund you could tap into. Patient:\u2002 I hope so. Therapist:\u2002 Well, do you want to start with the dean? If that \u00addoesn\u2019t work out, we can brainstorm other ideas: getting a job, moving in with someone else, borrowing from another relative\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. ",

Investigate Invalid Conclusions While an automatic thought might be true, the meaning may be invalid or at least not completely valid (as illustrated below), and you can exam- ine the underlying belief or conclusion. Therapist:\u2002 So it looks as if you really did hurt your friend\u2019s feelings. Patient:\u2002 Yeah, I feel so bad about it. Therapist:\u2002 What does it mean about you that you hurt her feelings? Or what are you afraid will happen? Patient:\u2002 I should never have said that to her. I\u2019m a terrible friend\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019m a terrible person! She\u2019ll never want to talk to me again! Therapist:\u2002 Okay, can we look at that first? What other evidence do you have that you\u2019re a terrible person? .\u2009.\u2009. Is there evidence on the other side, that maybe you\u2019re not? 184 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Work toward Acceptance Some problems cannot be solved and may never be solved, and patients need help in accepting that outcome. They may continue to feel miser- able if they have unrealistic expectations or hopes that an unresolvable problem will somehow, almost magically, improve. Meanwhile, they need assistance in learning to focus on their core values, emphasize the more rewarding parts of their lives, and enrich their experience in new ways. A number of strategies designed to enhance acceptance can be found in Hayes and colleagues (2004). Teaching Patients to Evaluate Their Thinking At some point, you may give a copy of the questions in Figure 11.1 to the patient. You could do so immediately following the part of a session in which you have verbally asked these questions. Or you would wait until a later time if your questioning was not very effective, if you \u00addon\u2019t have enough time to review Figure 11.1 with the patient, or if you think the patient would be overwhelmed. Many patients do better if you teach them just one or two questions, writing them on a separate piece of paper. You can give the full list to other patients and just mark the ques- tions as you review them. Learning to evaluate automatic thoughts is a skill. Some patients grasp it right away; others need much repeated, guided practice in a graded fashion. ",

Some patients grasp it right away; others need much repeated, guided practice in a graded fashion. For example, one patient might be helped with a variation of the \u201cevidence\u201d question: \u201cHow do I know this thought is true?\u201d Another patient who often catastrophizes might do better with a variation of the \u201cdecatastrophizing\u201d question: \u201cIf the worst happens, how would I cope? What are the best and most realistic outcomes?\u201d Still another patient might find it most useful to answer the \u201cdistanc- ing\u201d question: \u201cIf [my sister-in-law] were in this situation and had this thought, what would I tell her?\u201d When patients seem ready to learn this skill, select an automatic thought for which most of the questions in Figure 11.1 are likely to apply. Following an examination of one of Sally\u2019s automatic thoughts, I point out the process to her: Therapist:\u2002 If you\u2019re like most people, you may find that using these questions at home is sometimes harder than it looks. In fact, there will be lots of times when we really need to work together to help you examine a thought. But give it a try, and if you have trouble we can talk about it next week. Okay?  Evaluating Automatic Thoughts 185 Predicting that patients may have some difficulty can help allay self-criticism or defeatism if the assignment \u00addoesn\u2019t go smoothly. Had I suspected, despite my admonition, that Sally would judge herself harshly for not being able to fulfill the homework assignment perfectly, I would have pursued the subject more thoroughly: Therapist:\u2002 Sally, if you do have trouble evaluating your thoughts this week, how are you likely to feel? Patient:\u2002 Frustrated, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 What\u2019s likely to go through your mind? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. I\u2019ll probably just quit. Therapist:\u2002 Can you imagine looking at the sheet of paper and not being able to figure out what to do? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 What\u2019s going through your mind as you look at the paper? Patient:\u2002 \u201cI should be able to do this. I\u2019m so stupid.\u201d Therapist:\u2002 Good! Do you think it would help to have a written reminder that it\u2019s just a skill you\u2019ll get better at as you learn more and more here with me? Patient:\u2002 Yes. (Writes it in her therapy notes.) Therapist:\u2002 Do you think this response will help enough? Or do you think we should put off this assignment until we have more time to practice together? Patient:\u2002 No. I think I can try it. ",

Here I make the assignment into a no-lose proposition: Either Sally does it successfully, or she has some difficulty that I can help her with at the next session. If frustrated, she either reads her therapy notes (and probably feels better), or keeps track of her thoughts so she can learn to respond to them in the next session. Taking a Shortcut: Not Using the Questions at\u00a0All Finally, when patients have progressed in therapy and can automati- cally evaluate their thoughts, you may sometimes just ask them to devise an adaptive response. 186 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Patient:\u2002 [When I get ready to ask my roommate to keep the kitchen neater] I\u2019ll probably think I should just clean it better myself. Therapist:\u2002 Can you think of a more helpful way to view this? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. That it\u2019s better for me to stand up for myself. That I\u2019m doing something reasonable. I\u2019m not being mean or asking her to do more than her share. That she\u2019ll probably take it okay, like she did the last time I asked her to clean up. Therapist:\u2002 Good. What do you think will happen to your anxiety if you say that to yourself? Patient:\u2002 It\u2019ll go down. Here\u2019s another example: Therapist:\u2002 Anything you can think of that might get in the way of your starting the chemistry assignment? Patient:\u2002 I might think there\u2019s too much to do and get overwhelmed. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, if you do have the thought, \u201cThere\u2019s too much to do,\u201d what can you tell yourself? Patient:\u2002 That I \u00addon\u2019t have to do it all in one night, that I \u00addon\u2019t have to understand it perfectly this first time through. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Will that be enough, do you think, to go ahead and start the assignment? Evaluating automatic thoughts is a specific skill, one at which both therapists and patients improve with repeated practice. The next chapter describes how to help patients respond to their automatic thoughts.  187 Chapter 12 RESPONDING TO AUTOmATIC THOUGHTS T he previous chapter demonstrated how to help patients evaluate important automatic thoughts and determine the effectiveness of their evaluation in session.

The next chapter describes how to help patients respond to their automatic thoughts.  187 Chapter 12 RESPONDING TO AUTOmATIC THOUGHTS T he previous chapter demonstrated how to help patients evaluate important automatic thoughts and determine the effectiveness of their evaluation in session. This chapter describes how to facilitate patients\u2019 evaluation of and response to automatic thoughts between ses- sions. Patients experience two kinds of automatic thoughts outside of session: ones they have already identifi ed and evaluated in session, and novel cognitions. For the former group, you will ensure that patients have recorded robust responses in writing (on paper or an index card, in a therapy notebook, or on a smartphone) or in an audio format (on an audiotape or CD, in a recorded message on their phone, etc.). To respond to novel automatic thoughts between sessions, you will teach patients to use the list of questions in Figure 11.1 (either mentally or in writing), or to use a worksheet such as the Thought Record in Fig- ure 12.1 or an easier version, the \u201cTesting Your Thoughts\u201d Worksheet in Figure 12.2. But there are other ways to respond to automatic thoughts. Patients can engage in problem solving, use distraction or relaxation techniques, or label and accept their thoughts and emotions without evaluation. 188 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Reviewing Therapy Notes Having evaluated an automatic thought with patients (usually through Socratic questioning), you will ask them to summarize. For example, you might pose one of the following questions: \u201cCan you summarize what \u00adwe\u2019ve just been talking about?\u201d \u201cWhat do you think would be important for you to remember this week?\u201d \u201cIf the situation comes up again, what do you wish you could tell yourself?\u201d When patients express a cogent summary, you can ask them if they would like to record it, so they can better remember the response when similar automatic thoughts arise in the future. In the following tran- script, Sally and I have just evaluated her thought \u201cI \u00adcan\u2019t do it,\u201d using many of the questions in Figure 11.1 (page 172). I ask her to summa- rize. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, Sally, so if you open your chemistry text this week and again have the thought \u201cI \u00adcan\u2019t do it,\u201d what do you want to remind yourself? Patient:\u2002 That it\u2019s probably not true. That I can probably do at least some of it, because I have in the past, and I can get help if I \u00addon\u2019t understand all of it. I guess doing part of the reading is better than not doing any at all. Therapist:\u2002 That\u2019s good. Should we record that? Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. ",

It is desirable to have patients read their therapy notes each morn- ing and pull them out, as needed, during the day. Patients tend to inte- grate responses into their thinking when they have rehearsed them repeatedly. Reading notes only when encountering difficult situations  Responding to Automatic Thoughts 189 is usually less effective than reading them regularly in preparation for dif- ficult situations. Below are some of Sally\u2019s therapy notes. They contain: Responses to dysfunctional thinking, \u2022 Behavioral assignments, or \u2022 A combination of responses and \u2022 behavioral assignments. When I think \u201cI\u2019ll never get all my work done,\u201d remind myself: I just need to focus on what I need to do right now. I \u00addon\u2019t have to do everything perfectly. I can ask for help. It\u2019s not a sign of weakness. When I think \u201cI\u2019d rather stay in bed,\u201d tell myself that I always feel\u00a0a little better when I get something done and worse when I do nothing. 190 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND It might feel as if no one cares about me, but that\u2019s not true. My family, Allison, and Joe do. It\u2019s harder to feel their caring, but that\u2019s because I\u2019m depressed. The best thing to do is to stay in touch with them, so go call or text them.

It\u2019s an unpleasant feeling but it\u2019s not life  threatening, and it will decrease once I turn my attention to  something else. On a practical note, you should keep copies of your patients\u2019 therapy notes, photocopying them or using carbonless paper. You will probably find that you refer back to these therapy notes often, especially when reviewing patients\u2019 homework or reinforcing ideas you had discussed with patients in prior sessions. Also, a certain number of patients lose their notes and benefit greatly from a photocopy of your copy. Audio-Recorded Therapy Notes Ensuring that patients have written therapy notes is ideal. They can carry around a notebook or index cards to read as needed, or they can read their therapy notes on their smartphone. But some patients cannot or \u00addo not like to read. Or they find listening to notes to be more effective. In any case, you can turn on an audio recorder or have patients push the record button on their phone when you and they develop responses to automatic thoughts; or you can note what the responses are and turn on the recorder for the last few minutes of a session, recording all responses at once. Recording and then having patients listen to an entire therapy session is usually not as useful. They are likely to listen to the recording only once during the week, instead of repeatedly listening to the most important points of the session. Motivating patients to read therapy notes is similar to facilitating their doing any kind of homework (see Chapter 17). Initially, it is use- ful to have patients read their therapy notes at the end of a session and have them note that it takes less than a minute. When patients cannot read therapy notes, they may be able to listen to an audiotaped sum- mary or find someone in their environment who can read the notes to them. ",

Before suggesting that they use these questions at home when they feel upset, you will make sure that: They understand that evaluating their thinking can \u2022 help them feel better. They believe they will be able to use the questions \u2022 effectively at home. They understand that not all questions apply to all \u2022 automatic thoughts. You have shortened the list for patients who find \u2022 the entire list daunting or overwhelming. You also guide them as to when and how to use the questions, as I did with Sally: Therapist:\u2002 Sally, it would be too burdensome for you to use these questions for every automatic thought you have this week. That\u2019s one reason that you have therapy notes to read every morning and as needed during the day. But when you notice your mood getting worse and you catch your automatic thoughts, think to yourself, \u201cDo I have therapy notes that cover this?\u201d Okay? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 If you do, you have a choice. Use these questions or pull out your notes. Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 If you \u00addon\u2019t have notes, then you definitely will want to pull out the list at least some of the time. Now, ideally, you\u2019d not only ask yourself the questions, but you\u2019d also write down your answers, if you can. How does that sound? Patient:\u2002 Fine. Thought Records The Thought Record (TR), also known in an earlier version as the Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts (Beck et al., 1979), is a work-  Responding to Automatic Thoughts 193 sheet that prompts patients to evaluate their automatic thoughts when they feel distressed (see Figure 12.1). It elicits more information than just responding to the questions in Figure 11.1. It is not necessary for patients to use the TR if these questions are helpful, but many patients find the worksheet organizes their thinking and responses better. (The TR is not particularly useful, however, for patients who are low func- tioning, dislike writing, are unmotivated, or not well enough equipped intellectually to benefit from it.) ",

It is not necessary for patients to use the TR if these questions are helpful, but many patients find the worksheet organizes their thinking and responses better. (The TR is not particularly useful, however, for patients who are low func- tioning, dislike writing, are unmotivated, or not well enough equipped intellectually to benefit from it.) You might first use the list of questions in Figure 11.1 (page 172) with patients, then show them how to write the answers and other information on a Thought Record. In the following section, Sally and I have used the list of Socratic questions to evaluate her thought \u201cBob \u00adwon\u2019t want to go with me,\u201d and she feels better. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Now I\u2019d like to show you a worksheet that I think will help you at home, if that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s called a Thought Record\u2014 and it\u2019s just an organized way of writing down what we just did. Okay? (Pulls out Figure 12.1.) Patient:\u2002 Sure. Therapist:\u2002 Here it is. Now, before I start, I have to tell you a couple of things. First, spelling, handwriting, and grammar \u00addon\u2019t count. Second, this is a useful tool, and it may take some practice for you to get really good at it. So expect to make some mistakes along the way. These mistakes will actually be useful\u2014we\u2019ll see what was con- fusing, so you can do it better the next time. Okay? Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 Here\u2019s how you\u2019ll know when you should pull it out (point- ing to the top of the sheet). Do you see here at the top? It says, \u201cDirec- tions: When you notice your mood getting worse, ask yourself, \u2018What\u2019s going through my mind right now?\u2019 and as soon as possible jot down the thought or mental image in the Automatic Thought column.\u201d Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 Now, let\u2019s look at the columns. The directions are at the top of each. The first column is easy. When did you have that thought about Bob? Patient:\u2002 Friday afternoon, after class. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. You can write that in the first column. Patient:\u2002 (Does so.) Therapist:\u2002 Now, you\u2019ll see the second column prompts you to write down the situation. So you could put, \u201cThinking about asking Bob 194 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND if he wants to have coffee.\u201d(Pauses while Sally writes.) Now, the third column is for your automatic thoughts and how much you believe them. Here\u2019s where you write down the actual words or pictures that went through your mind. In this case, you had the thought, \u201cHe \u00adwon\u2019t want to go with me.\u201d How much did you believe the thought at that time? ",

You could write \u201c90%\u201d next to your thought, or \u201ca lot.\u201d And in the fourth column, you write your emotion and how intense it was. In this case, how sad did you feel? Patient:\u2002 Pretty sad\u201475%. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, write that down. (Waits for Sally to finish writing.) Next, look at the fifth column. It tells you to identify the cognitive distortion. Can you look at your list and tell me if you think your automatic thought falls into one of those categories? Patient:\u2002 I think it\u2019s fortune telling or mind reading. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Actually, it\u2019s both. Next, column five tells you to use the questions at the bottom. Do you want to write down the answers we just went over? Patient:\u2002 Okay. (Does so.) Therapist:\u2002 Now, the last column tells us how helpful this was. How much do you now believe the automatic thought? Patient:\u2002 Less. Maybe 50%. Therapist:\u2002 And how sad are you feeling? Patient:\u2002 Less. About 50%, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 So you can write that down. Patient:\u2002 (Does so.) Therapist:\u2002 I want you to remember what I told you before. \u00adDon\u2019t expect all your negative emotion to go away. But if doing a Thought Record helps a little, even 10%, it was worth doing. Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 So what do you think of the Thought Record? Do you want to try it this week at home? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I will. For some patients, it is better to introduce the Thought Record in two stages. In one session, you might teach patients to fill in the first four columns. If they successfully do so for homework, you can then teach them to use the final two columns.  195 Directions: When you notice your mood getting worse, ask yourself, \u201cWhat\u2019s going through my mind right now?\u201d and as soon as possible jot down the thought or mental image in the Automatic Thought(s) column.

Responding to Automatic Thoughts 197 When a Worksheet Is Not Sufficiently Helpful As with any technique in cognitive behavior therapy, it is important not to overemphasize the importance of worksheets. Most patients, at some point, find that completing a particular worksheet did not provide much relief. If you emphasize its general usefulness and \u201cstuck points\u201d as an opportunity for learning, you help patients avoid automatic thoughts critical of themselves, the therapy, the worksheet, or you. As described in the previous chapter, evaluation of an automatic thought (with or without a worksheet) may be less than optimal if patients fail to respond to their most upsetting thought or image, if their automatic thought is a core belief or activated an underlying belief, if their evaluation and response are superficial, or if they dis- count their response. Responding to Automatic Thoughts in\u00a0Other\u00a0Ways Sometimes you will use other methods to respond to automatic thoughts. For example, when patients have anxious, obsessive thoughts, you may teach them the \u201cAWARE\u201d technique (Beck & Emery, 1985) in which patients practice: A: Accepting their anxiety. ",

When patients\u2019 emotions are too high to effectively use their execu- tive function to evaluate their thoughts, you might use distraction or relaxation techniques, described in Chapter 15.  198 Chapter 13 IDENTIfYING AND mODIfYING INTERmEDIATE BElIEfS P revious chapters described the identifi cation and modifi cation of automatic thoughts, the actual words or images that go through a patient\u2019s mind in a given situation and lead to distress. This chapter and the next describe the deeper, often unarticulated ideas or under- standings that patients have about themselves, others, and their per- sonal worlds, that give rise to specifi c automatic thoughts. These ideas often are not expressed before therapy but can easily be elicited from the patient, or inferred and then tested. As described in Chapter 3, these beliefs may be classifi ed in two categories: intermediate beliefs (composed of rules, attitudes, and assumptions) and core beliefs (rigid, global ideas about oneself, others, or the world). Intermediate beliefs, while not as easily modifi able as automatic thoughts, are still more malleable than core beliefs. This chapter is divided into two parts. In the fi rst part, cognitive conceptualization (initially introduced in Chapter 3) is described, and the process of developing a Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram is illustrated. Conceptualization is emphasized throughout this volume to help the therapist plan therapy, become adept at choosing appropriate interventions, and overcome stuck points when standard interventions fail. Eliciting and modifying intermediate beliefs are the focus of the second part of this chapter. These techniques also apply to the next chapter, which presents additional specialized techniques for eliciting and mod- ifying core beliefs.  Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 199 Cognitive Conceptualization Generally, you will guide patients to work on automatic thoughts before directly modifying their beliefs. From the beginning, though, you start formulating a conceptualization, which logically connects automatic thoughts to the deeper-level beliefs. If you fail to see this larger picture, you will be less likely to direct therapy in an effective, efficient way. ",

If you fail to see this larger picture, you will be less likely to direct therapy in an effective, efficient way. You can start filling out a Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram (Figures 13.1 and 13.2) after the first session with a patient, if you have collected data in the form of the cognitive model (the bottom part of the diagram); that is, you have data about the patient\u2019s typical automatic thoughts, emotions, behavior, and/or beliefs. This diagram depicts, among other things, the relationship between core beliefs, intermedi- ate beliefs, and current automatic thoughts. It provides a cognitive map of the patient\u2019s psychopathology and helps organize the multitude of data that the patient presents. The diagram in Figure 13.1 illustrates the basic questions you will ask yourself to complete the diagram. When filling in data after the initial session, you should regard your first efforts as tentative; you have not yet collected enough data to determine the extent to which the automatic thoughts patients have expressed are very typical for them. The completed diagram will mis- lead you if you choose situations in which the themes of patients\u2019 auto- matic thoughts are not part of an overall pattern. After three or four sessions, you should be able to complete the bottom half with more confidence, as patterns should have emerged. You share your partial conceptualization with patients verbally (and sometimes on a blank piece of paper) at every session as you sum- marize their experience in the form of the cognitive model. Generally you will not share the worksheet, however, as many patients would find it confusing (or occasionally demeaning if they interpret the diagram as your attempt to \u201cfit\u201d them into boxes). Initially, you may have data to complete only a portion of the dia- gram. You either leave the other boxes blank, or fill in items you have inferred with a question mark to indicate their tentative status. You will check out missing or inferred items with the patient at future ses- sions. At some point you will share both the top and bottom parts of the conceptualization, when your goal for a session is to help patients understand the broader picture of their difficulties. ",

Whenever you present your interpretations, you will do so tentatively and label them as hypotheses, asking patients whether they \u201cring true.\u201d Correct hypotheses generally resonate with the patient.  200 Reprinted by permission in Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Basics and Beyond, Second Edition, by Judith S.

The meaning of the automatic thought for each situation should be logically connected with the Core Belief box near the top of the diagram. For example, Sally\u2019s diagram (Figure 13.2) clearly shows how her automatic thoughts, and the meaning of those thoughts are related to her core belief of incompetence. To complete the top box of the diagram, ask yourself (and the patient): How did the core belief originate and become maintained? What life events (especially those in childhood) did the patient experi- ence that might be related to the development and maintenance of the belief? Typical relevant childhood data include such significant events as continual or periodic strife among parents or other family members; parental divorce; negative interactions with parents, siblings, teachers, peers, or others in which the child felt blamed, criticized, or otherwise devalued; serious illness; death of significant others; physical or sexual abuse; and other adverse life conditions, such as moving frequently, experiencing trauma, growing up in poverty, or facing chronic discrim- ination, to name a few. The relevant childhood data may, however, be more subtle: for example, children\u2019s perceptions (which may or may not have been valid) that they did not measure up in important ways to their siblings; that they were different from or demeaned by peers; that they did not meet expectations of parents, teachers, or others; or that their parents favored a sibling over them. Next ask yourself, \u201cHow did the patient cope with this painful core belief? Which intermediate beliefs (i.e., underlying assumptions, rules, and attitudes) has the patient developed?\u201d Sally\u2019s beliefs are depicted hierarchically in Figure 13.3. As Sally has many intermediate beliefs that could be classified as attitudes or rules, it is particularly useful to list the key assumptions in the box below the core belief.

To complete the next box, \u201ccoping strategies,\u201d you ask yourself, \u201cWhich behavioral strategies did the patient develop to cope with the painful core belief?\u201d Note that the patient\u2019s broad assumptions often link the coping strategies to the core belief: \u201cIf I [engage in the coping strategy], then [my core belief may not come true; I\u2019ll be okay]. However, if I [do not engage in my coping strategy], then [my core belief is likely to come true].\u201d Sally\u2019s strategies were to develop high standards for herself, work very hard, overprepare for exams and presentations, remain vigilant for her shortcomings, and avoid seeking help (especially in situations in which asking for assistance could, in her mind, expose her incompe- tence). She believes that engaging in these behaviors will protect her from failure and the exposure of her incompetence (and that not doing them could lead to failure and exposure of incompetence). Another patient might have developed strategies that are the opposite of Sally\u2019s behaviors: avoiding hard work, developing few goals, underpreparing, and asking for excessive help. Why did Sally develop a particular set of coping strategies while a second patient developed I\u2019m incompetent. Core belief It\u2019s terrible to be incompetent. If I work extra hard, I can do okay. If I don\u2019t work hard, I\u2019ll fail. 1. Attitude: 2. Assumptions: Intermediate beliefs I can\u2019t do this. This is too hard.

Perhaps nature endowed them with different cogni- tive and behavioral styles; in interaction with the environment they developed different intermediate beliefs that reinforced their particu- lar behavioral strategies. The second patient, perhaps because of his childhood experiences, had the same core belief of incompetence, but coped with it by developing a different set of beliefs: \u201cIf I set low goals for myself I\u2019ll be okay, but if I set high goals I\u2019ll fail.\u201d \u201cIf I rely on others I\u2019ll be okay, but if I rely on myself I\u2019ll fail.\u201d Note that most coping strategies are normal behaviors that every- one engages in at times.

The difficulty of patients in distress lies in the overuse of these strategies at the expense of more functional strategies. Figure 13.4 lists a few examples of strategies that patients develop to cope with painful core beliefs. To summarize, the Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram is based on data patients present, their actual words. You should regard your hypotheses as tentative until confirmed by the patient. You will continu- ally reevaluate and refine the diagram as you collect additional data, and your conceptualization is not complete until the patient terminates treatment. While you might not show the actual diagram to patients, you will verbally (and often on paper) conceptualize their experience from the first session on, to help them make sense of their current reac- tions to situations. At some point, you will present the larger picture to patients so they can understand: FIGURE 13.4.\u2002 Typical coping strategies. Avoid negative emotion Display high emotion (e.g., to attract attention) Try to be perfect Purposely appear incompetent or helpless Be overly responsible Avoid responsibility Avoid intimacy Seek inappropriate intimacy Seek recognition Avoid attention Avoid confrontation Provoke others Try to control situations Abdicate control to others Act childlike Act in an authoritarian manner Try to please others Distance self from others or try to please only oneself  Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 205 How their earlier experiences contributed to the development \u2022 of core beliefs about themselves, their worlds, and others. How they developed certain assumptions or rules for living to \u2022 help them cope with their painful core beliefs. How these assumptions led to the development of particular \u2022 coping strategies or patterns of behavior that may (or may not) have been adaptive at the time but are no longer adaptive in many situations. Some patients are intellectually and emotionally ready to see the larger picture early on in therapy; you should wait to present it to others (espe- cially those with whom you do not have a sound therapeutic relation- ship, or who do not really believe in the cognitive model). As mentioned previously, whenever you present your conceptualization, ask the patient for confirmation, disconfirmation, or modification of each part. Identifying Intermediate and Core Beliefs You will identify intermediate beliefs by: 1.\t Recognizing when a belief is expressed as an automatic thought. 2.\t Providing the first part of an assumption. 3.\t Directly eliciting a rule or attitude. 4.\t ",

These strategies are illustrated below. 1.\u2002 First, a patient may actually articulate a belief as an automatic thought, especially when depressed. Therapist:\u2002 What went through your mind when you got the quiz back? Patient:\u2002 I should have done better. I \u00adcan\u2019t do anything right. I\u2019m so incompetent. [core belief] 206 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND 2.\u2002 Second, you may be able to elicit a full assumption by providing the first half of it. Therapist:\u2002 So you had the thought \u201cI\u2019ll have to stay up all night work- ing.\u201d Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 And if you \u00addon\u2019t work as hard as you possibly can on a paper or a project.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009? Patient:\u2002 Then I \u00adhaven\u2019t done my best. \u00adI\u2019ve failed. Therapist:\u2002 Does this sound familiar, based on what \u00adwe\u2019ve talked about before in therapy? Is this generally how you view your efforts, that if you \u00addon\u2019t work as hard as you can, then \u00adyou\u2019ve failed? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I think so. Therapist:\u2002 Can you give me some more examples so we can see how widespread this belief is?  Q:\t What if\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. patients have difficulty providing the second part of the assumption? A:\t Rephrase the question. Therapist:\u2002 Let me ask you about it this way: If you \u00addon\u2019t work as hard as you possibly can on a paper or project, what bad thing could happen? Or what bad thing would it mean?  3.\u2002 Third, you can identify a rule or an attitude by direct elicita- tion. Therapist:\u2002 So it\u2019s pretty important to you to do really well in your vol- unteer tutoring job? Patient:\u2002 Oh, yes. Therapist:\u2002 Do you remember our talking about this kind of thing before, having to do very well? Do you have a rule about that? Patient:\u2002 Oh\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I \u00adhadn\u2019t really thought of it\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I guess I have to do whatever I do really well. 4.\u2002 More often, you will use a fourth technique to identify interme- diate (and core) beliefs: the downward arrow technique (Burns, 1980).  Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 207 First, you identify a key automatic thought that you suspect may stem directly from a dysfunctional belief. ",

Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 207 First, you identify a key automatic thought that you suspect may stem directly from a dysfunctional belief. Then you ask the patient for the meaning of this cognition, assuming the automatic thought is true. Con- tinue to do so until you have uncovered one or more important beliefs. Asking what a thought means to the patient often elicits an intermedi- ate belief; asking what it means about the patient usually uncovers the core belief. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, to summarize, you were studying late last night, you were looking over your class notes, you had the thought, \u201cThese notes make no sense,\u201d and you felt sad. Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, now we \u00adhaven\u2019t yet looked at the evidence to see if you\u2019re right. But I\u2019d like to see if we can figure out why that thought made you feel so sad. To do that, we have to assume for a moment that you are right, your notes \u00addon\u2019t make sense. What would that mean to you? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addidn\u2019t do a very good job in class. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, if it\u2019s true that you \u00addidn\u2019t do a very good job in class, what would that mean? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m a lousy student. [The assumption is, \u201cIf I \u00addon\u2019t do a good job in school, it means I\u2019m a lousy student.\u201d] Therapist:\u2002 Okay, if you\u2019re a lousy student, what does that mean about you? Patient:\u2002 [core belief] I\u2019m not good enough. [I am incompetent.] Sometimes you can get stuck in the course of a downward arrow technique when the patient answers with a \u201cfeeling\u201d response, such as \u201cThat would be terrible,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d be so anxious.\u201d As in the example below, you will gently empathize, and then try to get back on track. To minimize the possibility that the patient will react negatively to your probing, you will provide a rationale for your repeated questioning and vary your inquiry through questions such as the following: \u201cIf that\u2019s true, so what?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst part about\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009.\u201d \u201cWhat does that mean about you?\u201d 208 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND The transcript below demonstrates the provision of a brief ratio- nale and the variation of questions in the downward arrow technique.

Patient:\u2002 Oh, I \u00adcouldn\u2019t stand it. Therapist:\u2002 So you\u2019d be pretty upset, but what would be the worst part about it? Patient:\u2002 They\u2019d probably look down on me. Therapist:\u2002 And if they did look down on you, what would be so bad about that? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019d hate that. Therapist:\u2002 Sure, you\u2019d be distressed if that happened. But so what if they looked down on you? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. That would be pretty bad. Therapist:\u2002 Would it mean something about you, if they looked down on you? Patient:\u2002 That I\u2019m inferior, not as good as they are. [The assumption is \u201cIf people look down on me, it means I\u2019m inferior.\u201d The core belief is \u201cI\u2019m inferior.\u201d] How do you know when to stop the downward arrow technique? Generally you have uncovered the important intermediate beliefs and/ or core belief when the patient shows a negative shift in affect, and/or begins to state the belief in the same or similar words. Therapist:\u2002 And what would it mean if you are inferior and not as good as they are? Patient:\u2002 Just that, I\u2019m inferior. 5.\u2002 A fifth way to identify beliefs is to look for common themes in a patient\u2019s automatic thoughts across situations. You can ask insightful patients whether they can identify a recurrent theme or you can make a hypothesis about a belief and ask the patient to reflect on its validity: Therapist:\u2002 Sally, in a number of situations you seem to think, \u201cI \u00adcan\u2019t do it,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s too hard,\u201d or \u201cI \u00adwon\u2019t be able to get it done.\u201d I wonder whether you believe that you are somehow incompetent or inad- equate? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I think I do. I do think I\u2019m incompetent.  Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 209 6.\u2002 A sixth way to identify beliefs is to ask the patient directly. Some patients are able to articulate their beliefs fairly easily. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, what is your belief about asking for help? Patient:\u2002 Oh, asking for help is a sign of weakness. 7.\t Finally, a patient may be asked to complete a belief question- naire, such as the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (Weissman & Beck, 1978) or the Personality Belief Questionnaire (A. T. Beck & Beck, 1991). Careful review of items that are strongly endorsed can highlight problematic beliefs. ",

T. Beck & Beck, 1991). Careful review of items that are strongly endorsed can highlight problematic beliefs. The use of such questionnaires is a useful adjunct to the techniques described above. To summarize, you can identify both intermediate and core beliefs in a number of ways. You can look for the expression of a belief in an automatic thought; provide the conditional clause (\u201cIf\u00a0 .\u2009.\u2009.) of an assumption and ask the patient to complete it; directly elicit a rule; use the downward arrow technique; recognize a common theme among automatic thoughts; ask patients what they think their belief is; or you can review the patient\u2019s belief questionnaire. Deciding Whether to Modify a Belief Having identified a belief, you need to determine whether the interme- diate belief is central or more peripheral. Generally, to conduct therapy as efficiently as possible, you focus on the most important intermediate beliefs (Safran, Vallis, Segal, & Shaw, 1986). It is not worth the time or effort to work on dysfunctional beliefs that are tangential, or that patients believe only slightly. Therapist:\u2002 It sounds as if you believe if people \u00addon\u2019t accept you, then you\u2019re inferior. Patient:\u2002 I guess. Therapist:\u2002 How much do you believe that? Patient:\u2002 Not that much, maybe 20%. Therapist:\u2002 It \u00addoesn\u2019t sound as if we have to work on that belief, then. How about if we get back to the problem we were discussing before? Having identified an important intermediate belief, you decide whether you will make the belief explicit to the patient and, if so, 210 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND whether you will merely identify the belief as one to be worked on in the future, or whether you will work on it at the present time. Ask yourself: \u201cWhat is the belief?\u201d \u201cHow strongly does the patient believe it?\u201d \u201cIf strongly, how broadly and how strongly does it affect the patient\u2019s life?\u201d \u201cIf broadly and strongly, should I work on it now? Is it likely the patient will be able to evaluate it with sufficient objectivity at this point? Do we have enough time in the session today to begin working on it?\u201d You will begin belief modification as soon as possible. When patients no longer endorse their beliefs or do not believe them as strongly, they will be able to interpret their experiences in a more realistic, func- tional way. ",

When patients no longer endorse their beliefs or do not believe them as strongly, they will be able to interpret their experiences in a more realistic, func- tional way. But some beliefs are very deeply held, and it is advisable to teach patients to evaluate their more superficial cognitions (automatic thoughts) first, so they can learn that just because they think or believe something \u00addoesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is true. Belief modification is relatively easy with some patients and much more difficult with others. Modifying intermediate beliefs is generally accomplished before modi- fying core beliefs, as the latter may be quite rigid. Educating Patients about Beliefs Having identified an important belief and checked that the patient believes it strongly, you may decide to educate the patient about the nature of beliefs in general, using a specific belief as an example. You might stress that there is a range of potential beliefs that the patient could adopt, and that beliefs are learned, not innate, and can be revised. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, \u00adwe\u2019ve identified some of your beliefs: \u201cIt\u2019s terrible to do a mediocre job\u201d; \u201cI have to do everything great\u201d; \u201cIf I do less than my best, I\u2019m a failure.\u201d Where do you think you learned these ideas? Patient:\u2002 Growing up, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 Does everyone have these same beliefs? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks.) No. Some people \u00addon\u2019t seem to care.  Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 211 Therapist:\u2002 Can you think of someone specifically who seems to have different beliefs? Patient:\u2002 Well, my cousin Emily, for one. Therapist:\u2002 What belief does she have? Patient:\u2002 I think she thinks it\u2019s okay to be mediocre. She\u2019s more inter- ested in having a good time. Therapist:\u2002 So she learned different beliefs? Patient:\u2002 I guess so. Therapist:\u2002 Well, the bad news is that you currently have a set of beliefs that \u00adaren\u2019t bringing you much satisfaction, right? The good news is that since you learned this current set of beliefs, you can unlearn them and learn others\u2014maybe not as extreme as Emily\u2019s, but some- where in between hers and yours. How does that sound? Changing Rules and Attitudes into Assumption Form It is often easier for patients to see the distortion in and test an inter- mediate belief that is in the form of an assumption, rather than an intermediate belief that is in the form of a rule or an attitude. Having identified a rule or an attitude, you use the downward arrow technique to ascertain its meaning. ",

Therapist:\u2002 How much do you believe this idea right now, \u201cIf I ask for help, I\u2019m incompetent?\u201d Logical evaluation of this conditional assumption through ques- tioning or other methods often creates greater cognitive dissonance than does evaluation of the rule or attitude. It is easier for Sally to rec- ognize the distortion and/or dysfunctionality in the assumption \u201cIf I ask for help, it means I\u2019m incompetent\u201d than in her rule \u201cI \u00adshouldn\u2019t ask for help.\u201d Examining Advantages and Disadvantages of Beliefs Often it is useful for patients to examine the advantages and disadvan- tages of continuing to hold a given belief. You then strive to minimize 212 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND or undermine the advantages and emphasize and reinforce the disad- vantages. (A similar process was previously described in the section on evaluating the utility of automatic thoughts on pages 174\u2013175.) Therapist:\u2002 What are the advantages of believing if you \u00addon\u2019t do your best, then you\u2019re a failure? Patient:\u2002 Well, it might make me work harder. Therapist:\u2002 It\u2019d be interesting to see whether you actually need such an extreme belief to keep you working hard. We\u2019ll get back to that idea later. Any other advantages? Patient:\u2002 .\u2009.\u2009. No, not that I can think of. Therapist:\u2002 What are the disadvantages of believing you\u2019re a failure if you \u00addon\u2019t do your best?

Therapist:\u2002 Okay, so on one hand, it may or may not actually be true that this belief is the only thing that makes you work hard. On the other hand, this belief about having to live up to your potential makes you feel miserable when you \u00addon\u2019t do great, makes you more nervous than you have to be before presentations, cuts into your enjoyment of your work, and stops you from doing other things you like. Is that right? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 Is this an idea, then, that you\u2019d like to change? Formulating a New Belief In order to decide which strategies to use to modify a given belief, you clearly formulate to yourself a more adaptive belief. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat belief would be more functional for the patient?\u201d For example, Figure 13.5 lists Sally\u2019s current beliefs and the new beliefs I have in mind. Although constructing a new belief is a collab- orative process, you nevertheless mentally formulate a range of more reasonable beliefs so you can appropriately choose strategies to change the old belief.  Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 213 To summarize, before you try to modify a patient\u2019s belief, you confirm that it is a central, strongly held belief, and you formulate in your own mind a more functional, less rigid belief that is thematically related to the dysfunctional one, but which you believe is more realis- tic and adaptive for the patient. You do not impose this belief on the patient, but rather you guide the patient in a collaborative manner, using Socratic questioning, to construct an alternative belief. You may also educate the patient about the nature of beliefs (e.g., that they are ideas, not necessarily truths; that they have been learned and so can be unlearned; that they can be evaluated and modified) and/or help the patient assess the advantages and disadvantages of continuing to hold the belief. Sally\u2019s old beliefs More functional beliefs 1.\t If I \u00addon\u2019t do as well as others, I\u2019m a failure. If I \u00addon\u2019t do as well as others, I\u2019m not a failure, just human. 2.\t If I ask for help, it\u2019s a sign of weakness. If I ask for help when I need it, I\u2019m showing good problem-solving abilities (which is a sign of strength). 3.\t If I fail at work/school, I\u2019m a failure as a person. If I fail at work/school, it\u2019s not a reflection of my whole self. ",

I \u00adshouldn\u2019t be able to excel at something unless I am gifted in that area (and am willing and able to devote considerable time and effort toward it at the expense of other things). 5.\t I should always work hard and do my best. I should put in a reasonable amount of effort much of the time. 6.\t If I \u00addon\u2019t live up to my potential, I have failed.

If I \u00addon\u2019t work hard all the time, I\u2019ll probably do reasonably well and have a more balanced life. FIGURE 13.5.\u2002 Formulation of more functional beliefs. 214 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Modifying Beliefs A number of strategies are useful in modifying both intermediate and core beliefs. (Additional techniques for modifying core beliefs are pre- sented in more detail in the next chapter.) Some beliefs may change easily, but many take concerted effort over a period of time. You con- tinue to ask patients how much they currently believe a given belief (0\u2013100%), at both an \u201cintellectual\u201d and at a \u201cgut\u201d or \u201cemotional\u201d level, to gauge whether further work is needed. It is usually neither possible nor necessarily desirable to reduce degrees of belief to 0%. Knowing when to stop working on a belief is therefore a judgment call. Generally, beliefs have been sufficiently attenuated when patients endorse them less than 30% and when they are likely to continue modifying their dysfunctional behavior despite still holding on to a remnant of the belief. It is advisable for patients to keep track, in their therapy notes, of the beliefs they have examined. ",

It is advisable for patients to keep track, in their therapy notes, of the beliefs they have examined. A useful format includes the dysfunc- tional belief; the new, more functional belief; and the strength of each belief, expressed in a percentage, as in the following example: Old belief: \u201cIf I \u00addon\u2019t achieve highly, I\u2019m a failure.\u201d (50%) New belief: \u201cI\u2019m only an overall failure if I actually fail at almost everything.\u201d (80%) A typical homework assignment is to read and rerate daily how strongly the patient endorses both beliefs. Techniques to modify beliefs are listed below. Some are the same as those used to modify automatic thoughts. 1.\t Socratic questioning. 2.\t Behavioral experiments. 3.\t Cognitive continuum. 4.\t Intellectual\u2013emotional role plays. 5.\t Using others as a reference point. 6.\t Acting \u201cas if.\u201d 7.\t Self-disclosure.  Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 215 Socratic Questioning to Modify Beliefs As illustrated in the next transcript, I use the same kinds of questions to examine Sally\u2019s belief that I used in evaluating her automatic thoughts. Even when I identify a general belief, I help her evaluate it in the con- text of specific situations. This specificity helps make the evaluation more concrete and meaningful, and less abstract and intellectual. Therapist:\u2002 [summarizing what they learned from the just-completed downward arrow technique] Okay, so you believe about 90% that if you ask for help, it means you\u2019re incompetent. Is that right? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 Could there be another way of viewing asking for help? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure. Therapist:\u2002 Take therapy, for example. Are you incompetent because you came for help here? Patient:\u2002 A little, maybe. Therapist:\u2002 Hmmm. That\u2019s interesting, because I usually view it in the opposite way. Is it possible it\u2019s actually a sign of strength and compe- tence that you came to therapy? Because what would have happened if you \u00adhadn\u2019t? Patient:\u2002 I might still be pulling the covers over my head. Therapist:\u2002 Are you suggesting that asking for appropriate help when you have an illness like depression is a more competent thing to do than remaining depressed? Patient:\u2002 Yeah\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I guess so. Therapist:\u2002 Well, you tell me. Let\u2019s say we have two depressed college students. One seeks treatment and the other \u00addoesn\u2019t, but continues to have depressive symptoms. Which do you consider more compe- tent? Patient:\u2002 Well, the one who goes for help. Therapist:\u2002 Now how about another situation \u00adyou\u2019ve mentioned\u2014your volunteer job. ",

It\u2019s not a sign of competence to just struggle if you could get help and do better. 216 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 How much do you believe that? Patient:\u2002 Pretty much\u201480%. Therapist:\u2002 And how do these two situations\u2014therapy and help in tutoring\u2014apply to you? Patient:\u2002 I guess they do. Therapist:\u2002 Let\u2019s have you write something down about this\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Let\u2019s call the first idea \u201cold belief\u201d\u2014now what did you say? Patient:\u2002 If I ask for help, I\u2019m incompetent. Therapist:\u2002 How much do you believe it now? Patient:\u2002 Less. Maybe 40%. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, write \u201c40%\u201d next to it. Patient:\u2002 (Does so.) Therapist:\u2002 Now, write \u201cnew belief.\u201d How would you put that? Patient:\u2002 If I ask for help, I\u2019m not incompetent? Therapist:\u2002 You \u00addon\u2019t sound convinced. Would it be better if you phrased it, \u201cIf I ask for help when it\u2019s reasonable, it\u2019s a sign of com- petence\u201d? Patient:\u2002 Yes. (Writes that.) Therapist:\u2002 How much do you believe the new belief now? Patient:\u2002 A lot\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. (Reads and ponders the new belief.) Maybe 70 to 80%. (Writes that down.) Therapist:\u2002 Okay, Sally, we\u2019ll be coming back to these beliefs again. How about for homework this week you do two things? One is to read these beliefs every day and rate how much you believe them\u2014 actually write down the percentage next to the beliefs themselves. Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 [providing a rationale] Writing down how much you believe them will make you really think about them. That\u2019s why I \u00addidn\u2019t say just read them. Patient:\u2002 Okay. (Writes down the assignment.) Therapist:\u2002 Second, could you be on the lookout for other situations this week where you could reasonably ask for help? That is, let\u2019s imagine that you believe the new belief 100%, that asking for rea- sonable help is a sign of competence. When during this coming week might you ask for help? Jot down those situations. Patient:\u2002 Okay.  ",

Jot down those situations. Patient:\u2002 Okay.  Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 217 In the previous segment, I use Socratic questioning in the context of specific situations to help Sally evaluate an intermediate belief. I judge that the standard questions of examining the evidence and evaluating outcomes will be less effective than leading Sally to develop an alterna- tive viewpoint. My questions are much more persuasive and less even- handed than when I help her evaluate more malleable cognitions at the automatic thought level. We devise a follow-up homework assignment that is designed to have Sally continue to reflect daily on both the dys- functional assumption and the new belief. Behavioral Experiments to Test Beliefs As with automatic thoughts, you can help patients devise behavioral tests to evaluate the validity of a belief. Behavioral experiments, when properly designed and carried out, can modify a patient\u2019s beliefs more powerfully than verbal techniques in the office. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, Sally, \u00adwe\u2019ve identified another belief: \u201cIf I ask for help, others will belittle me,\u201d and you believe that 60%. Of course, I \u00adhaven\u2019t actually belittled you, have I? Patient:\u2002 No, of course not. But that\u2019s your job, to help people. Therapist:\u2002 True, but it would be useful to find out if other people, in general, are more like me or not. How could you find out? Patient:\u2002 Ask other people for help, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, whom could you ask and for what kind of help? Patient:\u2002 Ummm. I\u2019m not sure. Therapist:\u2002 Could you ask your roommate? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, actually I already do. And I guess I could ask my resi- dent adviser for help with something. Therapist:\u2002 Good. How about your academic adviser? Patient:\u2002 Uh-huh. I could also ask my brother. No. I \u00adwon\u2019t ask my room- mate or my brother. I know they \u00adwouldn\u2019t belittle me. Therapist:\u2002 Oh, so you know already there are some exceptions? Patient:\u2002 Yes. But I guess I could go to my adviser or my teaching assis- tants. Therapist:\u2002 What could you ask for help with? Patient:\u2002 Well, the teaching assistants\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I could ask questions about the papers I have due or about the readings. The resident adviser, I \u00addon\u2019t know. My academic adviser\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I would feel a little funny going to her. ",

Patient:\u2002 True\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Therapist:\u2002 So you might kill two birds with one stone\u2014testing the belief that you\u2019ll be belittled and getting some guidance for a real- life problem you have. Patient:\u2002 I guess I could. Therapist:\u2002 Good. So would you like to test the belief, \u201cIf I ask others for help, they\u2019ll belittle me\u201d? How would you like to do that this week? In the previous segment, I suggested a behavioral experiment to test a belief. Had I sensed that Sally felt hesitant, I would have asked her how likely she was to do the experiment and what practical prob- lems or thoughts might get in her way. I might also have her do covert rehearsal (see pages 303\u2013305) to increase the likelihood of her follow- ing through. In addition, if I judged that there was the possibility of others\u2019 belittling Sally, I might have discussed in advance what such belittling would mean to her and how she could cope if the belittling did occur. Also, I might have asked Sally for a description of belittling to ensure that she would not inaccurately perceive others\u2019 behavior as belittling when they did not intend it to be. For an extensive description and discussion of behavioral experi- ments, see Bennett-Levy and colleagues (2004). Cognitive Continuum to Modify Beliefs This technique is useful to modify both automatic thoughts and beliefs that reflect polarized thinking (i.e., when the patient sees something in all-or-nothing terms). Sally, for example, believed that if she was not a superior student, she was a failure. Building a cognitive continuum for the concept in question facilitates the patient\u2019s recognition of the middle ground, as the following transcript illustrates: Therapist:\u2002 Okay, you believe pretty strongly that if you\u2019re not a supe- rior student, you\u2019re a failure. Let\u2019s see what that looks like graphi- cally. (Draws a number line.) Therapist:\u2002 Now, where does the superior student go? Patient:\u2002 Up here. I guess 90\u2013100%. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. And, you\u2019re a failure. Where are you? Patient:\u2002 At 0%, I guess.  ",

Patient:\u2002 Ummm\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Maybe this guy, Jack, who\u2019s in my economics class. I know he\u2019s doing worse than I am. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. We\u2019ll put Jack at 0%. But I wonder if there is anyone who\u2019s doing even worse than Jack? Patient:\u2002 Probably. Therapist:\u2002 Is it conceivable that there is someone who is failing almost every test, every paper? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, now if we put that person at 0%, a real failure, where does that put Jack? Where does that put you? Patient:\u2002 Probably Jack\u2019s at 30%. And I\u2019m at 50%. Therapist:\u2002 Now, how about a person who is actually failing everything, and he \u00adisn\u2019t even showing up at any classes or doing any of the read- ing or turning in any papers? Patient:\u2002 I guess he would be at 0%. Therapist:\u2002 Where does that put the student who is at least trying but not passing much? Patient:\u2002 I guess he would be at 10%. Therapist:\u2002 Where does that put you and Jack? Patient:\u2002 Jack goes to about 50%; I guess I\u2019m at 75%. Revised Success Graph 0% 10% 50% 75% 90% 100% Student who does nothing Student who tries, but gets failing grades Jack Sally Superior students Therapist:\u2002 How about for homework if you see whether even 75% is accurate? Even if it is for this school, perhaps for schools and stu- dents in general, you would rank higher. In any case, how accurate is it to call someone a failure who is at the 75% mark? 220 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Patient:\u2002 Not very. Therapist:\u2002 Maybe the worst thing you can say is that he or she is 75% successful. Patient:\u2002 Yeah. (Brightens visibly.) Therapist:\u2002 Okay, to get back to your original idea, how much do you believe now that if you are not a superior student, you\u2019re a failure? Patient:\u2002 Not as much. Maybe 25%. Therapist:\u2002 Good! The cognitive continuum technique is often useful when the patient is displaying dichotomous thinking. As with most techniques, you may directly teach the patient how to employ the technique herself so she can use it when it is applicable: Therapist:\u2002 Sally, let\u2019s review what we did here. ",

Then we drew a number line to see whether there were really only two categories\u2014success and fail- ure\u2014or whether it\u2019s more accurate to consider degrees of success. Can you think of anything else that you see in only two categories and that distresses you? Intellectual\u2013Emotional Role Play This technique, also called point\u2013counterpoint (Young, 1999), is usu- ally employed after you have tried other techniques such as those described in this chapter. It is particularly useful when patients say that intellectually they can see that a belief is dysfunctional, but that emotion- ally or in their gut it still \u201cfeels\u201d true. You first provide a rationale for asking patients to play the \u201cemotional\u201d part of their mind that strongly endorses the dysfunctional belief, while you play the \u201cintellectual\u201d part. In the second segment you switch roles. Note in both segments you and patients both speak as the patient; that is, you both use the word \u201cI.\u201d Therapist:\u2002 It sounds from what you\u2019re saying that you still believe to some extent that you\u2019re incompetent because you \u00addidn\u2019t do as well in school last semester as you would have liked. Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019d like to get a better sense of what evidence you still have that supports your belief. Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 Can we do a role play? I\u2019ll play the \u201cintellectual\u201d part of  Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 221 your mind that intellectually knows that just because you \u00addidn\u2019t get all A\u2019s \u00addoesn\u2019t mean you are incompetent through and through. I\u2019d like you to play the \u201cemotional\u201d part of your mind, that voice from your gut that still really believes you are incompetent. I want you to argue against me as hard as you can, so I can really see what\u2019s maintaining the belief. Okay? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, you start. Say \u201cI\u2019m incompetent because I \u00addidn\u2019t get all A\u2019s.\u201d Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m incompetent because I \u00addidn\u2019t get all A\u2019s. Therapist:\u2002 No, I\u2019m not. I have a belief that I\u2019m incompetent, but I am reasonably competent most of the time. Patient:\u2002 No, I\u2019m not. If I were truly competent, I would have gotten all A\u2019s last semester. Therapist:\u2002 That\u2019s not true. Competence \u00addoesn\u2019t equal total academic perfection. If that were true, only 1% of the students in the world would be competent, and everyone else would be incompetent. ",

        "text": "I want you to argue against me as hard as you can, so I can really see what\u2019s maintaining the belief. Okay? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, you start. Say \u201cI\u2019m incompetent because I \u00addidn\u2019t get all A\u2019s.\u201d Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m incompetent because I \u00addidn\u2019t get all A\u2019s. Therapist:\u2002 No, I\u2019m not. I have a belief that I\u2019m incompetent, but I am reasonably competent most of the time. Patient:\u2002 No, I\u2019m not. If I were truly competent, I would have gotten all A\u2019s last semester. Therapist:\u2002 That\u2019s not true. Competence \u00addoesn\u2019t equal total academic perfection. If that were true, only 1% of the students in the world would be competent, and everyone else would be incompetent. Patient:\u2002 Well, I got a C in chemistry. That proves I\u2019m incompetent. Therapist:\u2002 That\u2019s not right, either. If I had flunked the course perhaps it might be reasonable to say I \u00adwasn\u2019t competent in chemistry, but it \u00addoesn\u2019t make me incompetent in everything. Besides, maybe I really am competent in chemistry, but I flunked for other reasons; for example, I was depressed and \u00adcouldn\u2019t concentrate on my study- ing. Patient:\u2002 But a truly competent person \u00adwouldn\u2019t become depressed in the first place. Therapist:\u2002 Actually, even truly competent people get depressed. There \u00adisn\u2019t a connection there. And when truly competent people get depressed, their concentration and motivation definitely suffer and they \u00addon\u2019t perform as well as usual. But that \u00addoesn\u2019t mean they are incompetent through and through. Patient:\u2002 I guess that\u2019s true. They\u2019re just depressed. Therapist:\u2002 You\u2019re right, but you\u2019re out of role. Any more evidence that you\u2019re completely incompetent? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks for a moment.) No, I guess not. Therapist:\u2002 Well, how about if we trade roles now, and this time you be the \u201cintellectual\u201d part who disputes my \u201cemotional\u201d part? And I\u2019ll use your same arguments. Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019ll start. \u201cI\u2019m incompetent because I \u00addon\u2019t get all A\u2019s.\u201d 222 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Switching roles provides patients with an opportunity to speak with the intellectual voice that you have just modeled. You use the same emo- tional reasoning and the same words that the patients used. Using their own words and not introducing new material help patients to respond more precisely to their specific concerns. If patients are unable to formulate a response while in the intel- lectual role, you can either switch roles temporarily or come out of role to discuss the stuck point. As with any belief modification technique, you will evaluate both its effectiveness and the degree to which patients need further work on the belief. You do so by asking patients to rate how much they believe the belief after the intervention. Many patients find the intellectual\u2013emotional role play useful. A few, however, feel uncomfortable doing it. As with any intervention, the decision to use it should be collaborative. Because it is a slightly argu- mentative technique, take special note of patients\u2019 nonverbal reactions during the role play. ",

Using Other People as a Reference Point in\u00a0Belief\u00a0Modification When patients consider other people\u2019s beliefs, they often obtain psycho- logical distance from their own dysfunctional beliefs. They begin to see an inconsistency between what they believe is true or right for them- selves and what they more objectively believe is true about other people. Following are four examples of using other people as a reference point to gain distance. Example 1 Therapist:\u2002 Sally, you mentioned last week that you think your cousin Emily has a different belief about having to do everything great. Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 Could you put what you think her belief is into words? Patient:\u2002 She thinks she \u00addoesn\u2019t have to do great. She\u2019s an okay person, no matter what. Therapist:\u2002 Do you believe she\u2019s right? That she \u00addoesn\u2019t have to do great to be an okay person? Patient:\u2002 Oh, yes. Therapist:\u2002 Do you see her as incompetent, through and through?  Identifying and Modifying Intermediate Beliefs 223 Patient:\u2002 Oh, no. She might not get good grades, but she\u2019s competent in lots of other ways. Therapist:\u2002 I wonder if Emily\u2019s belief could apply to you: \u201cIf I \u00addon\u2019t do great, I\u2019m still an okay, competent person.\u201d Patient:\u2002 Hmmm. Therapist:\u2002 Is there something different about Emily that makes her okay and competent no matter how well or poorly she does, but not you? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks for a moment.) No. I \u00addon\u2019t think so. I guess I \u00adhadn\u2019t really thought of it that way. Therapist:\u2002 How much do you believe right now, \u201cIf I \u00addon\u2019t do great, I\u2019m incompetent\u201d? Patient:\u2002 Less, maybe 60%. Therapist:\u2002 And how much do you believe this new belief, \u201cIf I \u00addon\u2019t do great, I\u2019m still an okay, competent person\u201d? Patient:\u2002 More than before. Maybe 70%. Therapist:\u2002 Good. How about if we have you write down the new belief and start making a list of the evidence that supports this new belief. At this point, you might introduce the Core Belief Worksheet, described in Chapter 14, which can be used for both core beliefs and intermediate beliefs. ",

At this point, you might introduce the Core Belief Worksheet, described in Chapter 14, which can be used for both core beliefs and intermediate beliefs. Example 2 Another way to help patients modify an intermediate or core belief is to have them identify someone else who plainly seems to have the same dysfunctional belief. Sometimes patients can see the distortion in some- one else\u2019s thinking and apply this insight to themselves. This technique is analogous to the Thought Record question: \u201cIf [friend\u2019s name] was in this situation and had this thought, what would I tell [him/her]?\u201d Therapist:\u2002 Is there someone else you know who has your same belief, \u201cIf I \u00addon\u2019t work hard, I\u2019ll fail\u201d? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m sure my friend Rebecca, from high school, believes that. She\u2019s always studying, night and day. Therapist:\u2002 How accurate do you think that belief is for her? Patient:\u2002 Oh, not at all. She\u2019s very bright. She probably \u00adcouldn\u2019t fail if she tried. 224 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 Is it possible that she might consider anything less than an A a failure, too? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I know she does. Therapist:\u2002 And do you agree with her, that if she gets a B, then she\u2019s failed? Patient:\u2002 No, of course not. Therapist:\u2002 How would you view it? Patient:\u2002 She got a B. An okay grade, not the best, but not a failure. Therapist:\u2002 What belief would you like her to have? Patient:\u2002 It\u2019s good to work hard and try for A\u2019s, but it\u2019s not the end of the world if you \u00addon\u2019t get them. And it \u00addoesn\u2019t mean \u00adyou\u2019ve failed. Therapist:\u2002 How does all this apply to you? Patient:\u2002 Hmmm. I guess it\u2019s the same. Therapist:\u2002 Could you spell out what\u2019s the same? Patient:\u2002 That if I \u00addon\u2019t get all A\u2019s, I \u00adhaven\u2019t failed. I still think I should work hard, though. Therapist:\u2002 Sure. It\u2019s reasonable to want to work hard and do well. The unreasonable part is to believe \u00adyou\u2019ve failed if you \u00adhaven\u2019t done perfectly. Do you agree with that? Example 3 You could also do a role play with patients in which you instruct them to convince another person that the belief they both share is invalid for the other person. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, you say you think your roommate also believes that she \u00adshouldn\u2019t go to a professor for help because he might think she\u2019s unprepared or not smart enough? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 Do you agree with her? Patient:\u2002 No. She\u2019s probably wrong. ",

Therapist:\u2002 Oh, I \u00adcouldn\u2019t do that. He\u2019ll think I\u2019m dumb. He\u2019ll think I\u2019m wasting his time. Patient:\u2002 Hey, it\u2019s his job to help students. Therapist:\u2002 But he probably \u00addoesn\u2019t like students bothering him. Patient:\u2002 Tough, that\u2019s what he\u2019s getting paid for. Anyway, good profes- sors like to help students. If he\u2019s impatient, that says something about him, not about you. Therapist:\u2002 But even if he \u00addoesn\u2019t mind helping, he\u2019ll find out how confused I am. Patient:\u2002 That\u2019s okay. He \u00adwon\u2019t expect you to know everything. That\u2019s why you\u2019re coming to him. Therapist:\u2002 What if he thinks I\u2019m dumb? Patient:\u2002 First of all, you \u00adwouldn\u2019t be here if you were dumb. Second, if he does expect you to know everything, he\u2019s just wrong. If you did know everything, you \u00adwouldn\u2019t be taking his course. Therapist:\u2002 I still think I \u00adshouldn\u2019t go. Patient:\u2002 No, you should. \u00adDon\u2019t let his snobby attitude make you feel like you\u2019re imposing or you\u2019re dumb. You\u2019re not. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. I\u2019m convinced. Out of role, how does what you told your roommate apply to you? Example 4 Finally, many patients can get distance from a belief by using their own children (or children they know) as a reference point, or by imagining that they have children. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, so you believe 80% that if you \u00addon\u2019t do as well as everyone else, then \u00adyou\u2019ve failed? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 I wonder, can you imagine that you have a daughter? She\u2019s 10 years old and in fifth grade, and she comes home one day very, very upset because her friends got A\u2019s on a test and she got a C. Would you want her to believe that she\u2019s a failure? Patient:\u2002 No, of course not. Therapist:\u2002 Why not?\u00a0 .\u2009.\u2009. What would you like her to believe? (Sally responds.) Now how does what \u00adyou\u2019ve just said apply to you? 226 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Acting \u201cAs If\u201d Changes in belief often lead to corresponding changes in behavior.

And changes in behavior, in turn, often lead to corresponding changes in belief. If a belief is fairly weak, the patient may be able to change a target behavior easily and quickly, without much cognitive intervention. Many beliefs do require some modification before the patient is willing to change behaviorally. However, frequently only some belief modifica- tion, not complete belief change, is needed. And once patients begin to change their behavior, the belief itself becomes somewhat more attenu- ated (which makes it easier to continue the new behavior, which further attenuates the belief, and so on, in a positive upward spiral). Therapist:\u2002 Okay, Sally, how much do you believe now that it\u2019s a sign of weakness to ask for help? Patient:\u2002 Not as much. Maybe 50%. Therapist:\u2002 That\u2019s a good drop. Would it be to your benefit to act as if you \u00addon\u2019t believe it at all? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure what you mean. Therapist:\u2002 If you \u00addidn\u2019t believe it was a sign of weakness, in fact, if you believed it was good to ask for help, what might you do this week? Patient:\u2002 Well, \u00adwe\u2019ve been talking about my going to see the teaching assistant. I guess if I really believed it was good to ask for help, I would go. Therapist:\u2002 Anything else? Patient:\u2002 I might try to find a tutor for Economics\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I might ask to bor- row notes from the guy down the hall\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Therapist:\u2002 Hey, that\u2019s good. And what positive things could happen if you did some of these things? Patient:\u2002 (Laughs.) I could get the help that I need.

The self-disclosure, of course, should be genuine and relevant: Therapist:\u2002 You know, Sally, when I was in college, I had some trouble going to professors for help because I thought I\u2019d be showing my ignorance too. And to tell you the truth, the few times I did end up doing it anyway, I had mixed results. Sometimes the professors were really nice and helpful. But a couple of times, they were pretty brusque, just told me to reread a chapter or something. The point is, just because I \u00addidn\u2019t understand something \u00addidn\u2019t mean I was incompetent. And the professors who were brusque\u2014well, I think that said a lot more about them than about me. (pause) What do you think? In summary, you help patients to identify intermediate beliefs by recognizing when a belief has been expressed as an automatic thought, by providing part of an assumption, by directly eliciting a rule or an atti- tude, by using the downward arrow technique, by looking for common themes among the patient\u2019s automatic thoughts, and/or by reviewing a belief questionnaire completed by the patient. You next determine how important the belief is by ascertaining how strongly the patient believes it, and how broadly and strongly it affects her functioning. Then you decide whether to begin the task of modifying it in the current session or wait for future sessions. When beginning belief modification work, you educate the patient about the nature of beliefs, change rules and atti- tudes into assumption form, and explore the advantages and disadvantages of a given belief. You mentally formulate a new, more functional belief and guide the patient toward its adoption through many belief modification techniques, including Socratic questioning, behavioral experiments, cognitive continua, intellectual\u2013emotional role plays, using others as a reference point, acting \u201cas if,\u201d and self-disclosure. Some of these tech- niques are more persuasive than standard Socratic questioning of auto- matic thoughts, because the beliefs are much more rigidly held. These same techniques can also be used to modify core beliefs.  228 Chapter 14 IDENTIfYING AND mODIfYING CORE BElIEfS C ore beliefs, as described in Chapter 3, are one\u2019s most central ideas about the self.

Some authors refer to these beliefs as schemas. Beck (1964) differentiates the two by suggesting that schemas are cogni- tive structures within the mind, the specifi c content of which are core beliefs. Furthermore, he theorizes that negative core beliefs essentially fall into two broad categories: those associated with helplessness and those associated with unlovability (Beck, 1999). A third category, asso- ciated with worthlessness, has also been described (J. S. Beck, 2005). Some patients have core beliefs that fall in one category; others have core beliefs in two or all three categories. People develop these beliefs from an early age, as children, with their genetic predisposition toward certain personality traits, interact with signifi cant others, and encounter a series of situations. For much of their lives, most people maintain relatively positive and realistic core beliefs (e.g., \u201cI am substantially in control\u201d; \u201cI can do most things com- petently\u201d; \u201cI am a functional human being\u201d; \u201cI am likable\u201d; \u201cI am worth- while\u201d). Negative core beliefs may surface only during times of psycho- logical distress. (Some patients with personality disorders, however, may have almost continuously activated negative core beliefs.) Often, unlike automatic thoughts, core beliefs that patients \u201cknow\u201d to be true about themselves are not fully articulated until you peel back the layers by continuing to ask for the meaning of their thoughts.  Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 229 It is important to note that patients may also have negative core beliefs about other people and their worlds: \u201cOther people are untrust- worthy\u201d; \u201cOther people will hurt me\u201d; \u201cThe world is a rotten place\u201d; \u201cThe world is dangerous.\u201d Fixed, overgeneralized ideas such as these often need to be evaluated and modified, in addition to core beliefs about the self. Before Sally became depressed, she recognized when she was act- ing competently and interpreted signs of possible incompetence as situ- ation specific; for example, when she got a lower grade than expected on a paper in high school, she took it as an instance of inadequacy, but she did not interpret this situation as meaning she was an overall incompetent person. As Sally was becoming depressed, her positive schema became deac- tivated and her negative schema containing the cognition \u201cI am incom- petent\u201d became almost fully activated. As illustrated on page 34, Sally began to overemphasize and overgeneralize negative data, contained in negative rectangles, continually reinforcing her belief that she was incompetent. ",

As illustrated on page 34, Sally began to overemphasize and overgeneralize negative data, contained in negative rectangles, continually reinforcing her belief that she was incompetent. At the same time, Sally was failing to recognize a signifi- cant amount of positive data related to her schema (such as resuming her usual activities even though the depression made it very difficult to do so); these positive triangles \u201cbounced off\u201d the schema and did not get incorporated. Sally also discounted much positive information through her \u201cYes, but\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009.\u201d interpretations of her experiences (\u201cYes, I did well on the quiz, but it was easy.\u201d; \u201cYes, I helped the kid I was tutoring, but I got lucky because I really \u00addidn\u2019t know what I was doing.\u201d). These positive triangles were, in essence, changed into negative rectangles. Sally was not volitionally processing information in this dysfunc- tional way. This kind of information processing is automatic and a symptom of depression. I recognized that it would be important to work directly on modifying her negative core belief, not only to alleviate her current depression, but also to prevent or reduce the severity of future episodes. For example, one day when Sally was depressed, she received a B\u2013 on an exam. She immediately understood this data as signifying that she was an incompetent person. When she received an A on a paper the next day, her mind automatically discounted this positive evidence that was contrary to her negative core belief. She believed the good grade was not an indication of competence; in fact, she believed that she was incompetent and that she had merely \u201cfooled\u201d the professor. She also failed to recognize other positive data; for example, that she got to every class on time. (Note that had she gotten to class late or skipped class, she would have interpreted those experiences in a negative light, as confirming her negative core belief.) 230 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND You will begin to work directly on belief modification as early in treatment as possible. Once patients change their beliefs, they are less likely to process data in a maladaptive way. In specific situations, they have different (more adaptive and realistic) automatic thoughts and improved reactions.

Once patients change their beliefs, they are less likely to process data in a maladaptive way. In specific situations, they have different (more adaptive and realistic) automatic thoughts and improved reactions. You may not succeed with early belief modification, though, if patients: Have core beliefs that are quite rigid and overgeneralized. \u2022 Do not yet believe that cognitions are ideas and not \u2022 necessarily truths. Experience very high levels of affect when beliefs are \u2022 elicited or questioned. Do not have a strong enough alliance with you (they \u2022 may not trust you sufficiently; they may not perceive you as understanding who they really are; they may feel invalidated by the process of belief evaluation). In these cases, you will teach patients the tools of identifying, evaluat- ing, and adaptively responding to automatic thoughts and intermediate beliefs before using the same tools for core beliefs. You may unwittingly try to evaluate a core belief early in treatment because it has been expressed as an automatic thought. Such evalua- tion may have little effect. In another case, you may intentionally test the modifiability of a core belief even before you have done much work at the automatic thought and intermediate belief level. The degree of difficulty in identifying and modifying core beliefs varies from patient to patient. In general, patients who are in significant emotional distress are more easily able than others to express their core beliefs (because the beliefs are activated in session). And, in general, it is far easier to modify the negative core beliefs of Axis I patients whose counterbalancing positive core beliefs have been activated throughout much of their lives. Negative core beliefs of patients with personality disorders are usually much more difficult to modify (J. S. Beck, 2005; Beck et al., 2004; Young, 1999) because they typically have fewer posi- tive core beliefs, their positive core beliefs are weaker, and they have developed a multitude of strongly held negative core beliefs that inter- connect and support each other like a network. In identifying and modifying core beliefs, you do the following during the course of treatment (each step is described later in this chapter):  Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 231 1.\t Mentally hypothesize from which category of core belief (\u201chelplessness\u201d or \u201cunlovability\u201d or \u201cworthlessness\u201d) specific automatic thoughts appear to have arisen (see Figure 14.1). 2.\t Specify the core belief (to yourself) using the same techniques you use to identify patients\u2019 intermediate beliefs. 3.\t Present your hypothesis about the core belief to patients, asking for confirmation or disconfirmation; refine your hypothesis about the core belief as patients provide additional data about current and childhood situations and their reactions to them. 4.\t ",

Categorizing Core Beliefs As mentioned previously, patients\u2019 core beliefs may be categorized in the helplessness realm, the unlovability realm, and/or the worthlessness realm. Whenever patients present data (problems, automatic thoughts, emotions, behavior, history), you \u201clisten\u201d for the category of core belief that seems to have been activated. For example, when Sally expresses thoughts about her work being too hard, about her inability to concen- trate, and about her fears of failing, I hypothesize that a core belief in the helpless category was operating. Sally occasionally mentions auto- matic thoughts that her friends might not want to spend time with her because she is depressed. When I do the downward arrow technique, asking what that means about her, she shrugs and says, with little emo- tion: \u201cI just \u00adwon\u2019t have anyone to hang out with.\u201d Sally does not seem to have a significant core belief of unlovability. 232 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Another patient consistently expresses thoughts of others not car- ing about him and fears that he is too different from others to sustain a relationship. This patient has a core belief in the category of unlov- ability. A third patient is frustrated by her inability to get others to listen to her. Although her distress occurs only in interpersonal situations, she does not believe that she is unlovable. Her core belief of helpless- ness is what gets activated. Finally, a fourth patient feels like a worth- less human being, not because he cannot achieve (a helpless belief), and not related to his relationships (which might possibly be an unlov- able belief). He believes that morally, he is a bad person (a worthless belief). ",

Themes include being ineffective: In getting things done (\u201cI\u2019m inadequate\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m incompetent\u201d; \u201cI \u2022 \u00adcan\u2019t do anything right\u201d). In protecting oneself (\u201cI\u2019m vulnerable, weak, powerless, \u2022 trapped\u201d). In achievement (\u201cI\u2019m a failure, I \u00addon\u2019t measure up, I\u2019m a \u2022 loser\u201d). The middle of Figure 14.1 lists typical core beliefs in the unlovable cat- egory. Themes include being unlikable, undesirable, unappealing, or defective (not in achievement or morality, but being defective in char- acter so as to preclude gaining the sustained love and caring of others). The bottom of Figure 14.1 lists worthless core beliefs. When patients have beliefs in this category, they are not unduly concerned with their efffectiveness or lovability. They just believe that they are bad, unwor- thy, or even dangerous to other people. Sometimes it is clear in which category a given core belief belongs, especially when patients actually use words such as \u201cI am helpless,\u201d or \u201cI am unlovable.\u201d At other times, you may not know initially which cat- egory of core belief has been activated. For example, depressed patients may say, \u201cI\u2019m not good enough.\u201d You need to ascertain the meaning of the cognition to determine whether they believe they are not good enough to achieve or to gain respect (helpless category), or if they are not good enough for others to love them (unlovable category). To summarize, you begin mentally to formulate a hypothesis about patients\u2019 core beliefs whenever they provide data in the form of their automatic thoughts (and associated meanings) and reactions (emo- tions and behaviors). You first make a gross distinction (to yourself) among cognitions that seem to fall in the helpless, unlovable, or worth- less categories.  Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 233 Identifying Core Beliefs You use the same techniques to identify patients\u2019 specific core beliefs that you used when identifying their intermediate beliefs (see Chapter 13). In addition to the downward arrow technique, you look for central themes in patients\u2019 automatic thoughts, watch for core beliefs expressed as auto- matic thoughts, and directly elicit the core belief. You will often identify a core belief early in therapy to conceptual- ize patients and plan treatment. ",

Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m doing pretty badly at them, too. Therapist:\u2002 So this idea that you\u2019re incompetent extends to other things, too? Patient:\u2002 Just about everything. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, I can see how strongly you believe this idea. Can we go back to the situation in which you \u00adcouldn\u2019t finish the statistics assignment and you had the thoughts: \u201cI \u00adcan\u2019t do anything right. I\u2019ll never be able to make it here.\u201d In this example, I use the downward arrow technique to identify an idea I conceptualize as a core belief. I gently test its strength, breadth, and modifiability, and decide not to pursue further evaluation at this time. However, I label it as an \u201cidea\u201d (implying it is not necessarily a truth) and mark it as a future topic.  Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 235 Presenting Core Beliefs When you believe that you have collected sufficient data to hypothesize about the core belief, and when you believe patients will be sufficiently receptive, you tentatively pose your conceptualization to them, as I did below. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, \u00adwe\u2019ve talked about a number of different problems in the past few weeks\u2014your schoolwork, decisions about how to spend the summer, your volunteer job. Whenever we examine your thoughts, and ask you what they mean about you, you consistently say they mean that you\u2019re incompetent .\u2009.\u2009. Is that right? Patient:\u2002 Yes. I still think I\u2019m incompetent. Or you might review with patients a number of related automatic thoughts they had in a variety of situations and then ask them to draw a conclusion as to an underlying pattern (\u201cSally, do you see a common theme in these automatic thoughts?\u201d). With certain patients you can use a hand-drawn diagram, a simpli- fied version of the Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram (page 200), early in treatment. Either with or without the diagram, you might briefly explore childhood precursors. Therapist:\u2002 Do you remember feeling incompetent like this at other times in your life, too? As a child? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, sometimes. I remember never being able to do things my brother could. Therapist:\u2002 Can you give me some examples? ",

Patient:\u2002 Yeah, sometimes. I remember never being able to do things my brother could. Therapist:\u2002 Can you give me some examples? You will use historical data later, when you hypothesize to patients how they came to believe a core belief, and explain how the core belief could be untrue or mostly untrue even though they currently believe it so strongly. Educating Patients about Core Beliefs and\u00a0Monitoring Their Operation It is important for patients to understand the following about a core belief: 236 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND That it is an idea, not necessarily a truth. \u2022 That they can believe it quite strongly, even \u201cfeel\u201d it to be \u2022 true, and yet it might be mostly or entirely untrue. That, as an idea, it can be tested. \u2022 That it may be rooted in childhood events, and may or \u2022 may not have been true at the time they first came to believe it. That it continues to be maintained through the operation \u2022 of their schemas, in which they readily recognize data that support the core belief while ignoring or discounting data to the contrary. That you and they, working together, can use a variety of \u2022 strategies over time to change this idea so that they can view themselves in a more realistic way. In the transcript that follows, I educate Sally about her core belief. (She had previously confirmed the conceptualization I had pre- sented.) Therapist:\u2002 Sally, does this [automatic thought that she will not be able to write her economics paper] sound familiar? Do you think your idea that you\u2019re incompetent could be getting in the way? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. I do feel incompetent. Therapist:\u2002 Well, Sally, one of two things has been going on. The prob- lem is either you really are incompetent, and we\u2019ll have to do some work together to make you more competent\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. or the problem is that you believe you are incompetent; and sometimes, you believe it so strongly that you actually act in an incompetent way, like not going to the library to start researching your paper. (pause) What do you think? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. Therapist:\u2002 Why \u00addon\u2019t we write these two possibilities on paper? This is what I\u2019d like to start doing in therapy, if it is okay with you, seeing which possibility seems more true\u2014that you really are incompe- tent, or that you believe you\u2019re incompetent.

Later I explain core beliefs to Sally, in small parts, making sure she understands as I proceed.  Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 237 Therapist:\u2002 This idea, \u201cI\u2019m incompetent,\u201d is what we call a core belief. Let me tell you a little bit about core beliefs so you\u2019ll understand why they\u2019re more difficult to evaluate and respond to. Okay? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 First of all, a core belief is an idea that you may not believe very strongly when you\u2019re not depressed. On the other hand, we\u2019d expect you to believe it almost completely when you are depressed, even if there\u2019s evidence to the contrary. (pause) Follow me so far? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 When you get depressed, this idea becomes activated. When it\u2019s activated, you\u2019ll easily notice any evidence that seems to support it, and you\u2019ll tend to ignore any evidence that contradicts it. It\u2019s as if there is a screen around your head. Anything that fits in with the idea that you are incompetent sails straight through the screen and into your head. Any information that contradicts the idea \u00adwon\u2019t fit through the screen, and so either you \u00addon\u2019t notice it, or you change it in some way so it will fit through the screen. Do you think you might be screening information like this? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure. Therapist:\u2002 Well, let\u2019s see. Looking back at the past few weeks, what evidence is there that you might be competent? Patient:\u2002 Ummm\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I got an A on my statistics exam. Therapist:\u2002 Good! And did that evidence go right through the screen? Did you tell yourself, \u201cI got an A. That means I\u2019m smart or compe- tent or a good student,\u201d or anything like that? Patient:\u2002 No. I said, \u201cWell, the exam was easy. I learned some of that stuff last year.\u201d Therapist:\u2002 Oh, so it looks like the screen was operating. Do you see how you discounted information that contradicted your core belief, \u201cI am incompetent\u201d? Patient:\u2002 Hmmm. Therapist:\u2002 Can you think of any other examples from this week? Situ- ations where a reasonable person might think something you did showed you were competent, even if you \u00addidn\u2019t? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks for a moment.)

Maybe this is another instance of not giving yourself credit, when another person might have thought it was evidence that you are not incompetent. Patient:\u2002 Well, my roommate did think I helped her a lot. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, just to summarize: \u201cI\u2019m incompetent\u201d seems to be a core belief that goes back a long time with you, and which you believe much more strongly when you\u2019re depressed. Can you sum- marize how it seems to work? Patient:\u2002 Well, you\u2019re saying that when I\u2019m depressed, I screen in infor- mation that agrees with it and I screen out information that \u00addoesn\u2019t agree with it. Therapist:\u2002 Right. How about for homework this week if you try to notice each day how the screen is operating\u2014jot down information that seems to support the idea that you\u2019re incompetent. And here\u2019s the harder part. Really hunt for and jot down any information that another person might think contradicts it. Okay? In the next session, I explain why Sally believes her core belief so strongly and how it could still be untrue. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, you did a good job this week noticing how you tend to let in only the negative information that seems to support your idea that you\u2019re incompetent. As we predicted, it was much harder to recognize positive information that contradicts your idea. Patient:\u2002 Yeah. I \u00addidn\u2019t do it very well. Therapist:\u2002 Are you feeling incompetent now? Patient:\u2002 (Laughs.) Yes. I guess so. Therapist:\u2002 Is the screen operating right now? Did you put more emphasis on the part of the homework you \u00addidn\u2019t do as well, and forget about the part you did do well? Patient:\u2002 I guess I did. Therapist:\u2002 What do you think is the effect of having a screen like this? Patient:\u2002 Makes me not notice the good things. Therapist:\u2002 Right. And, day after day, what happens to this idea, \u201cI\u2019m incompetent\u201d? Patient:\u2002 Gets stronger, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 Right.

Patient:\u2002 Well, I can kind of see it intellectually, but I still do feel incom- petent. Therapist:\u2002 That\u2019s pretty common. In the next few weeks, we\u2019ll keep evaluating this idea. And then we\u2019ll work together on helping the more reasonable, intellectual part of your mind talk to the more emotional side. Okay? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Alternatively, I could have drawn the schema diagram from page 34 and elicited the same examples of positive and negative data, and asked Sally whether she thought the diagram accurately illustrated how she was processing information. I would then ask her, \u201cSally, if it\u2019s true that \u00adyou\u2019ve been overemphasizing the negative data and ignoring or discounting the positive data, can you see how your idea that you\u2019re incompetent could grow stronger with each passing hour and each passing day and week and month\u2014but it might not be true, or not com- pletely true?\u201d Bibliotherapy can reinforce important core belief work. Prisoners of Belief (McKay & Fanning, 1991) and Reinventing Your Life (Young & Klosko, 1994) are helpful in this phase of treatment. Developing a New Core Belief Many depressed patients had a different core belief, a more positive, reality-based, and functional idea about themselves, before the onset of their Axis I disorder. They may easily identify this belief. Therapist:\u2002 Before you got depressed, say a year ago, how did you see yourself? Did you think you were unlikable? Patient:\u2002 No; I mean, not everyone liked me, but I basically thought I was a good person. People liked me. Therapist:\u2002 So was your belief \u201cI\u2019m likable\u201d? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, it was. When patients cannot express their former idea, you mentally devise a new, more realistic, and functional belief and guide patients toward it. A relatively positive belief is generally easier for patients to adopt than a belief that is at an extreme. ",

For example: 240 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Old core belief New core belief \u201cI\u2019m (completely) unlovable.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m generally a likable person\u201d \u201cI\u2019m bad.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m powerless.\u201d \u201cI have control over many things.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m defective.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m normal, with both strengths and weaknesses.\u201d Therapist:\u2002 Sally, \u00adwe\u2019ve been talking about this core belief, \u201cI\u2019m incom- petent.\u201d What do you intellectually think a more accurate belief might be? Patient:\u2002 I am competent? Therapist:\u2002 That\u2019s good. Or we could work on a new belief that might be easier for you to adopt, say, \u201cI\u2019m competent in most ways, but I\u2019m only human, too.\u201d Which sounds better? Patient:\u2002 The second. Having identified a negative core belief and devised a positive belief, you will simultaneously work on weakening the first and strengthening the latter. Strengthening New Core Beliefs You will primarily strengthen new core beliefs in two ways. One, from the beginning of treatment, as described on pages 26\u201327, you deliber- ately elicit positive data from patients through questioning, and you also point out positive data to them\u2014especially when the data contra- dict the old, negative core belief but support a new, more reality-based belief. Two, when specifically working on strengthening their new core beliefs, you ask patients to examine their experiences in a new way that facilitates their ability to recognize positive data themselves. I accomplished the tasks of eliciting and pointing out positive data in several ways with Sally. For example: At the evaluation, I asked Sally what her strengths were. \u2022 Later, whenever applicable, I asked her whether certain data indi- \u2022 cated other strengths. (\u201cSo you did all these things: you made a list of all your assignments for this week and figured out when you would do them and what resources you would need. Is being organized a strength of yours?\u201d) During the first part of the session, I asked Sally about her posi- \u2022 tive experiences (\u201cWhat positive things happened since I saw  Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 241 you last?\u201d).

Finishing a paper, doing reasonably well on an exam, being assertive with her roommate, figuring out which classes to sign up for, starting a self-defense class, to name a few examples, all provided data that I emphasized at the time and later that supported her new core belief. I suggested that Sally keep a credit list (page 275). \u2022 I continually asked Sally for (positive) evidence that her cogni- \u2022 tions were not true, or not completely true. I asked for her attribution when she displayed positive behaviors \u2022 (\u201cWhat does it say about you that you were the one to initiate the recycling project?\u201d). I provided her with feedback about her accomplishments and \u2022 positive qualities (\u201cIt sounds like you did a great job organizing the get-together for the dorm\u201d). The second strategy involves helping patients adopt a different view of their experiences. They do so by asking themselves what they are doing or what is happening that could lend support to the new core belief. (\u201cSally, can you keep track this coming week of anything that shows that you are competent?\u201d) If patients have difficulty with this assignment, you can modify it. (\u201cSally, could you pretend I\u2019m following you around this week? Notice the times when you think I would say, \u2018That shows you\u2019re competent,\u2019 or could you notice what your room- mate does that shows you she\u2019s competent\u2014and then see whether you\u2019re doing the same thing?\u201d) Most patients need a visual or audio cue to remind themselves to look for positive data throughout the day, for example, they can wear a rub- ber band around their wrist, post sticky notes, have pop-up reminders on their computers or smartphones, or set the alarm on their cell phone to ring periodically. Encourage them to record the data in some way, instead of just making mental notes that they are likely to forget. A Core Belief Worksheet (Figure 14.3) can help them organize their note taking. Finally, it is important to track with patients how strongly they believe their new core belief over time, both at an intellectual level and an emotional level. You will elicit instances in which their degree of belief was relatively higher and reinforce their interpretation, and you will help them reframe the meaning of experiences in which their belief was relatively lower.

Modifying Negative Core Beliefs To help patients change their negative core beliefs, you will use many techniques described in the previous chapter, as well as others that are 242 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND described below (see Figure 14.2). Core beliefs usually change at the intellectual level first, especially when you have been employing intel- lectual-level techniques. Patients may need emotional-level techniques to change their core beliefs at the emotional level. The Core Belief Worksheet Having identified the old core belief and developed a new one, you may introduce the Core Belief Worksheet (CBW; see Figure 14.3), or draw a modified chart. Patients fill out the CBW in session and for homework as they moni- tor the operation of their beliefs and reframe evidence that seemed to support the old belief. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, let me show you a Core Belief Worksheet, which is just an organized way of working on your beliefs. I\u2019d like us to keep this sheet in front of us during our sessions to see whether the topic we\u2019re discussing is relevant to competency. Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 Learning to fill out this sheet takes time and practice, just as it took you a while to get good at the Thought Record. Okay? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 All right. Is it okay if we start with the right side, evidence that you\u2019re incompetent? Patient:\u2002 Sure.

Now, let\u2019s think if there could be another explana- tion for why you might not have understood the concept other than that you\u2019re incompetent. Patient:\u2002 Well, it was the first time she talked about it. And it \u00adwasn\u2019t in the readings. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Now might you be able to understand it after she has reviewed it, or \u00adyou\u2019ve read something about it, or asked some- one else to explain it better? Patient:\u2002 Probably. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. Now next to the \u201cBUT\u201d you\u2019ll write what we call the \u201creframe\u201d\u2014another, more helpful way of looking at the evidence. What could you say here? Evidence supporting new core belief I\u2019m competent but human Evidence supporting old core belief I\u2019m incompetent with reframe Did well on literature paper. Asked a question in statistics. Understand this worksheet. Made decisions about next year. Arranged to switch phones, bank accounts, insurance, etc. Got together all the references I need for econ paper. Understood most of Chapter 6 in statistics book. Explained statistics concept to guy down the \u00adhall. Didn\u2019t understand econ concept in class BUT I \u00adhadn\u2019t read about it and I\u2019ll probably understand it later. At worst it\u2019s an incompetency but maybe it\u2019s actually her fault for not explaining it well \u00adenough. Didn\u2019t go to the teaching assistant for help BUT that \u00addoesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m incompetent. I was nervous about going because I think I should be able to figure out these things myself and I thought he\u2019d think I was unprepared. Got a B on my literature paper, BUT it\u2019s an okay grade. If I were really incompetent, I \u00adwouldn\u2019t even be here. FIGURE 14.3.\u2002 Sally\u2019s Core Belief Worksheet.

Therapist:\u2002 Is it possible that many competent people \u00addon\u2019t necessarily grasp concepts at the first presentation? Patient:\u2002 True.

Okay, let\u2019s try the left side now. What evidence do you have from today that you are competent at many things? I\u2019ll warn you, this can be hard if your screen is oper- ating. Patient:\u2002 Well, I worked on my literature paper. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Write that down. What else? Patient:\u2002 I asked a question in my statistics course. Therapist:\u2002 You did! Good. What else? Patient:\u2002 (No response.) Therapist:\u2002 How about the fact that you seem to grasp how to do this worksheet? Patient:\u2002 I guess so. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, how about for homework if you try to add to this sheet every day? Can you see that to start, doing the first part of the right side will be easiest, but the second part and the left side will probably be harder? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 So do what you can. It may be that we\u2019ll have to work together to do the reframes and look for positive evidence. I\u2019ll give you a clue, though. If you have trouble with these two parts, pre- tend someone else, your roommate, for example, has done exactly what \u00adyou\u2019ve done, and see how you\u2019d view her actions. Okay? Patient:\u2002 Sure.  Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 245 Therapist:\u2002 Can you think of anything that might get in the way of your doing this assignment this week? Patient:\u2002 No, I\u2019ll try it. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Had Sally displayed difficulty in identifying positive data during the session, I might have postponed this homework assignment, trying dif- ferent techniques in session first to help her successfully elicit items for the left side. For example, I might use a contrasting technique: Therapist:\u2002 How about the fact that you battled your way through the student health system so you would get seen right away? \u00adDoesn\u2019t that belong on the left side?

Other ways of having patients recognize positive data that belong on the left side of the worksheet include asking patients:  1.\t To think of data that they would say were positive evidence for another person: \u201cSally, can you think of someone else who you consider is competent in most ways? Who would that be? What have you done today that you would say shows that [this person] is competent if she or he had done it?\u201d 2.\t To name another person who would say the data indicate positive evidence about the patient: \u201cSally, who\u2019s someone you think knows you pretty well, whose judgment you trust? What would [this person] say you had done today that\u2019s evidence you\u2019re competent?\u201d or \u201cSally, what have you done today that I probably think indicates you\u2019re competent?\u201d 3.\t To reflect on whether they would discount specific positive evidence if they compared what they did to a hypothetical negative model: \u201cSally, you \u00addon\u2019t believe that finishing that brief paper is a sign of competence. But would a truly incompetent person have 246 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND  been able to write it? Would a truly incompetent person even have made it to where you are now?\u201d 4.\t To rate the strength of their beliefs at the intellectual and emotional levels at the beginning of each session, before setting the agenda. Then you can ask, \u201cWhen you believed least strongly that you were incompetent or most strongly that you were competent, what was going on? Is this something we should put on the agenda?\u201d Discussing these (more positive) situations provides an opportunity to gather or reinforce evidence for the left side. You may also take the opportunity throughout the session to ques- tion patients about the applicability of the CBW to the topic at hand.

Therapist:\u2002 Good. Can you see how this is relevant to the Core Belief Worksheet? Patient:\u2002 Yes. It\u2019s the same idea. Therapist:\u2002 How can you write it down on the worksheet? Patient:\u2002 I guess it goes on the right side\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I \u00addidn\u2019t get the research assistant job\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. but that \u00addoesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m completely incompetent. A lot of people applied for it, some with lots more experience than me. Using Extreme Contrasts to Modify Core Beliefs At times, it is helpful for patients to compare themselves with someone, either real or imagined, who is at a negative extreme of the quality related to their core belief. You suggest that patients imagine someone within their frame of reference. (This technique is similar to the cogni- tive continuum described in Chapter 13.) Therapist:\u2002 I wonder, do you know anyone at your school who truly is incompetent or at least behaves very incompetently? Patient:\u2002 Ummm\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. There is one guy in my dorm who never, I think,  Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 247 goes to classes or does work. He just seems to party all the time. I think he\u2019s failing. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, so compared to him, how incompetent are you? Patient:\u2002 (Pauses.) Not very. Therapist:\u2002 If you truly were an incompetent person, through and through, what would you be doing differently? Patient:\u2002 .\u2009.\u2009. I guess I\u2019d drop out of college, sit around all day\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. not support myself\u00a0 .\u2009.\u2009. not do anything worthwhile\u00a0 .\u2009.\u2009. not have any friends\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009.

Patient:\u2002 I guess it\u2019s really not accurate. Using Stories, Movies, and Metaphors You can help patients develop a different idea about themselves by encouraging them to reflect on their view of characters or people who share the same negative core belief.

Therapist:\u2002 How close are you to that now? Patient:\u2002 Not at all, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 So how accurate would you say it is to label yourself as truly incompetent? Patient:\u2002 I guess it\u2019s really not accurate. Using Stories, Movies, and Metaphors You can help patients develop a different idea about themselves by encouraging them to reflect on their view of characters or people who share the same negative core belief. When patients experience vivid examples of the invalidity of others\u2019 very strongly held core beliefs, they begin to understand how they, too, could have a very strong core belief that is not accurate. One patient was sure that she was bad because as a child, and later as an adult, her mother had been physically and emotionally abusive to her, often telling the patient how bad she was. It was helpful for this patient to reflect on the story of Cinderella, in which a wicked step- mother treats a child quite badly without the child\u2019s being at fault. Historical Tests of the Core Belief When patients\u2019 core beliefs stem from early experiences, it is often use- ful to have them examine how their belief originated and was main- tained through the years (Young, 1999). You elicit and help patients reframe evidence that seemed to support the core belief from an early age, and also to uncover evidence that contradicted it. (You can use the CBW to collect data.) Usually, this process is initiated after patients have been monitoring the operation of their core belief in the present and have started the process of modifying it. First you provide a ratio- nale: 248 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 Sally, I\u2019d like to see where this idea that you\u2019re incompe- tent started. Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 Let\u2019s pull out the Core Belief Worksheet. Do you remember anything when you were quite young that made you believe at the time that you were incompetent? Say, before elementary school? Patient:\u2002 I remember preschool. I remember doing something with puzzles and the teacher yelling at me. I was crying\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Therapist:\u2002 Were you slow to finish it? Patient:\u2002 Yes, something like that. Therapist:\u2002 And you felt pretty incompetent? Patient:\u2002 Uh-huh. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, write that down on the right-hand side. We\u2019ll fill in the reframes later. What else? Patient:\u2002 I remember this time my family went to the state park. Every- one else could ride their bikes around, but I \u00adcouldn\u2019t keep up, and I got left really far behind. Either in session or for homework, patients continue this first step: recording memories that may have contributed to the establishment or maintenance of the core belief. They may reflect on preschool, elemen- tary school, high school, college, their 20s, and succeeding decades. ",

They may reflect on preschool, elemen- tary school, high school, college, their 20s, and succeeding decades. The second step of the historical review involves searching for and recording evidence that supports the new, positive belief for each period. Having evoked more positive memories, patients are ready for the third step: reframing each piece of negative evidence. Finally, in the fourth step, patients summarize each period. For example: High School Years\u2014I did a lot of things competently, from sports to being responsible for a lot of things at home to doing well at school. It\u2019s true that I \u00addidn\u2019t get all A\u2019s, and I \u00adwasn\u2019t good at everything, and I felt incompetent at times, but basically I was competent. Restructuring Early Memories For many Axis I patients, the \u201cintellectual\u201d techniques that have already been presented are sufficient to modify a core belief, as long as they are employed in the presence of emotion (i.e., that the core belief has been activated and the patient is experiencing negative affect). For oth- ers, special \u201cemotional\u201d or experiential techniques, in which patients\u2019  Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 249 affect is aroused, are also indicated. One such technique involves role- playing, reenacting an event to help patients reinterpret an earlier, traumatic experience. In the transcript that follows, I help a patient restructure the meaning of an earlier event related to a current distress- ing situation. Therapist:\u2002 Annie, you look pretty down today. Patient:\u2002 Yes. (crying)\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. My boss called me into his office this after- noon. He said I made a couple of typos in an e-mail I sent out for him, and that I have to be more careful and proofread my e-mails better. Therapist:\u2002 What went through your mind when he said that? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m a terrible secretary. I \u00adcan\u2019t do anything right. Therapist:\u2002 How are you feeling? Patient:\u2002 [expressing her emotion] Sad. Real sad. [expressing her core belief] And, you know, incompetent. Therapist:\u2002 In proofreading some e-mails or overall? Patient:\u2002 Overall, I\u2019m completely incompetent. Therapist:\u2002 [heightening her affect to facilitate memory retrieval] Do you feel this sadness and incompetency somewhere in your body? Patient:\u2002 Behind my eyes. And my shoulders feel heavy. Instead of focusing on this current situation, I elicit a past experi- ence with the same theme. First we talk about it on the intellectual level. Therapist:\u2002 When is the first time you remember feeling this way, as a kid? Patient:\u2002 (pause) When I was 6. ",

I remember I brought home my report card, and I was a little scared because I \u00adhadn\u2019t done very well. My dad was okay about it, but my mom got pretty mad. Therapist:\u2002 What did she say? Patient:\u2002 She yelled, \u201cAnnie, what am I going to do with you? Just look at this report card!\u201d Therapist:\u2002 What did you say?

Therapist:\u2002 Do you think this was a reasonable way for her to act? Patient:\u2002 (Thinks.) No\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I guess not. Therapist:\u2002 Well, is this something you\u2019d say to your own kids some day? Patient:\u2002 No. I\u2019d never say that. Therapist:\u2002 What would you say if you had a 6-year-old daughter who brought home a report card like that? Patient:\u2002 Ummm\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I guess I\u2019d say what my father did, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. \u00adDon\u2019t feel bad. I \u00addidn\u2019t do great in school either, and it \u00addidn\u2019t mat- ter one bit.\u201d Therapist:\u2002 That\u2019s good. Do you have any idea why your mother \u00addidn\u2019t say that? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure. Therapist:\u2002 I wonder, from what \u00adyou\u2019ve told me before, if it could be because she thought other people might look down on her if her kids \u00addidn\u2019t do well. Patient:\u2002 That\u2019s probably right. She was always bragging about my brother to her friends. I think she was always trying to keep up with the Joneses. Next I change the focus of our discussion so the patient can engage in experiential learning: Therapist:\u2002 Okay, how about if we do a role play. I\u2019ll play you at age 6; you play your mom. Try to see things from her point of view as much as you can. I\u2019ll start\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Mom, here\u2019s my report card. Patient:\u2002 Annie, I\u2019m ashamed of you. Look at these grades. What am I going to do with you? Therapist:\u2002 Mom, I\u2019m only 6.

Therapist:\u2002 Mom, I \u00addidn\u2019t do that bad. Why are you making such a big deal? You\u2019re making me feel like I\u2019m completely incompetent. Is that what you mean to do? Patient:\u2002 No, of course not. I \u00addon\u2019t want you to think that. It\u2019s not true. I just want you to do better.  Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 251 Next I help the patient draw a different conclusion about the expe- rience: Therapist:\u2002 Okay, out of role. What do you think? Patient:\u2002 I \u00adwasn\u2019t really incompetent. I did okay. Mom probably was hard on me because she \u00addidn\u2019t want to be criticized. Therapist:\u2002 How much do you believe that? Patient:\u2002 I think I do believe it. Therapist:\u2002 How about if we do the role play again, but this time we\u2019ll switch parts. Let\u2019s see how well the 6-year-old Annie can talk back to her mother. Following this second role play, I ask Annie what she learned, and how this learning applies to the situation that upset her this week (get- ting criticized by her boss). Another technique uses imagery to restructure early memories in the presence of affect (J. S. Beck, 2005; Edwards, 1989; Layden, New- man, Freeman, & Morse, 1993; Smucker & Dancu, 1999; Young, Klosko, & Weishaar, 2006). This Gestalt type technique has been adapted spe- cifically to change core beliefs and is more often used with patients with personality disorders than with Axis I patients. In the following case example, I help a patient reexperience an early distressing event that seems to have contributed to the origin or maintenance of a key core belief. I do the following: 1.\t Identify a specific situation that is currently quite distressing to the patient and seems linked to an important core belief. 2.\t Heighten the patient\u2019s affect by focusing on automatic thoughts, emotions, and somatic sensations linked with this situation. 3.\t Help the patient identify and reexperience a relevant early experience. 4.\t Talk to the \u201cyounger\u201d part of the patient to identify automatic thoughts, emotions, and beliefs. 5.\t Help the patient develop a different understanding of the experience through guided imagery, Socratic questioning, dialogue, and/or role play.

In the following transcript, Annie reports an upsetting experi- ence from the previous day in which she felt criticized by women in her church group with whom she was working on a fundraising project. 252 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 Can you imagine this scene again, as if it\u2019s happening right now? You\u2019re all sitting around the table\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. (I have Annie vividly pic- ture and describe the distressing incident in the present tense.) Patient:\u2002 Peggy is saying, \u201cAnnie, \u00adyou\u2019ve got to go back to the stores and find out who the managers or owners are and talk to them about contributing\u2014the clerks \u00addon\u2019t have the authority.\u201d And I\u2019m feeling so down, so sad.

Therapist:\u2002 Okay, just focus on your eyes, your stomach, your chest\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. (Waits about 10 seconds.) Annie, when do you remember feeling this heaviness before, when you were a kid? When\u2019s the first time you remember feeling like this? In the next section, I have Annie relate a distressing, significant memory with the same theme as the current upsetting experience. Annie describes (in the past tense) how critical her mother was when Annie stayed up late to do a homework assignment in second grade and how incompetent she felt. I then ask Annie to relate this experience again, this time telling it to me as her younger self, as if experience is happening right now. I interview the \u201cchild\u201d part of Annie, continually reinforcing the emotional immediacy of the experience by having the patient use the present tense throughout.

I then ask Annie to write down the old belief that was activated in this memory and the new belief, and to rate how much she now believes each one at an intellectual level and at an emotional level. Then we discuss the present distressing incident involving her friend Peggy and the church group, and help Annie draw a more real-  Identifying and Modifying Core Beliefs 255 ity-based, adaptive conclusion. By the end of the session, Annie believes only 20% that she is incompetent and 70% that she is competent. She believes an alternative explanation quite strongly: that her contribution may not live up to Peggy\u2019s expectations, but that does not mean that she is incompetent. This was her first experience with fundraising, and the more experienced members had not given her enough information. Even if someone else in the group could have done a better job, it does not mean that Annie is completely incompetent as a person. In summary, core beliefs require consistent, systematic work. A number of techniques applicable to restructuring automatic thoughts and intermediate beliefs may be used along with more specialized tech- niques oriented specifically toward core beliefs.

Typical core beliefs of patients with a variety of psychiatric disorders are described in Riso, du Toit, Stein, and Young (2007).  256 Chapter 15 ADDITIONAl COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAl TECHNIQUES A number of cognitive and behavioral techniques have previously been introduced, among them Socratic questioning, behavioral experiments, intellectual\u2013emotional role-playing, Core Belief Work- sheets, imagery, and listing advantages and disadvantages of beliefs. This chapter describes other important techniques, many of which are both cognitive and behavioral in nature. As described more fully in Chapter 19, you will choose techniques according to your overall conceptualization and goals for a particular session. You will also cre- ate your own techniques as you become more profi cient as a cognitive behavior therapist. The techniques described in this chapter, as is the case for all cog- nitive behavior therapy techniques, aim to infl uence the patient\u2019s think- ing, behavior, mood, and physiological arousal. They include problem solving, making decisions, refocusing, relaxation and mindfulness, coping cards, graded task assignments, exposure, role play, the \u201cpie\u201d technique, self-comparisons, and credit lists. Additional techniques are described in various sources (Beck et al., 1979; Beck & Emery, 1985; Leahy, 2003; McMullin, 1986). PROBlEm SOlVING AND SkIllS TRAINING Associated with or in addition to their psychological disorders, patients have real-life problems. At every session, you will encourage patients to  Additional Techniques 257 put on the agenda problems that have come up during the week that still distress them and problems they anticipate in the coming weeks. You will encourage patients to devise solutions to their problems, ask- ing them how they have solved similar problems in the past, or how they might advise a close friend or family member to solve the same kind of problem. You will then offer potential solutions, if needed. To spur your thinking, you might ask yourself how you have solved or would have solved a similar problem. Some patients are deficient in problem-solving skills. They may benefit from direct instruction in problem solving, where they learn to specify a problem, devise solutions, select a solution, implement it, and evaluate its effectiveness (see, e.g., D\u2019Zurilla & Nezu, 2006). And many patients also have skill deficits. ",

And many patients also have skill deficits. They require skills training from you or from an outside source in such areas as effective parenting, job interviewing, budgeting, and relationship skills. Self-help books can be useful; for example, McKay, Davis, and Fanning (2009) offer a client guide to improving communication. Other patients, however, already have good problem-solving and other skills. They may need help in testing dysfunctional beliefs that impede problem solving or using the skills they already possess. A prob- lem-solving worksheet (J. S. Beck, 2011) helps patients specify a prob- lem and identify and respond to interfering cognitions before discuss- ing potential solutions. Sally, for example, had difficulty concentrating when she was study- ing. She and I brainstormed solutions. She could start with the easiest assignment first, review relevant class notes before reading the text- book, write down questions when she was unsure of her understanding, and pause every few minutes to rehearse mentally what she had just read. We agreed she would try these strategies as experiments to see which, if any, facilitated her concentration and comprehension. A few sessions later, Sally put her volunteer job on the agenda. She had started tutoring a child at a nearby elementary school. Although the child was cooperative, Sally felt unsure of what she was doing. Intel- lectually she knew how to solve the problem; she realized she should contact the agency that coordinated the volunteers and/or the child\u2019s teacher. Her belief that she should not ask for help, however, inhibited her. After evaluating her automatic thoughts and beliefs about this spe- cific situation, Sally implemented the solution she herself had initially conceived. I used self-disclosure to help Sally when she brought up the prob- lem of procrastination. She was avoiding doing research for a paper she had to write. I told her that I often find the few moments or minutes just before starting a task I was avoiding the most unpleasant. Once I actually start doing the task, I invariably feel better. Sally recognized 258 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND that she often had the same experience, and we set up a behavioral experiment to see what would happen later that afternoon when she went online to start her research. Some problem solving may involve significant life changes. ",

Some problem solving may involve significant life changes. After careful evaluation of a situation, you might encourage battered spouses to seek refuge or take legal action. If you have patients who are chroni- cally dissatisfied with their job, you might guide them in analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of staying in their current job ver- sus looking for another job. Not all problems, of course, can be ame- liorated. In such cases, however, patients may be able to change their response to problems by modifying their cognitions. They may need to accept the status quo and work on making other aspects of their lives more satisfying. Some patients are chronic worriers about problems that are highly unlikely to occur. For these patients, you may need to help them differ- entiate between low-probability and higher-probability problems and between taking reasonable and unreasonable precautions. You also need to help them accept uncertainty, recognize and build personal and external resources, and increase their sense of self-efficacy, so they will have more confidence that if problems do arise, they will be able (by themselves or with the help of others) to handle them. Making Decisions Many patients, especially those who are depressed, have difficulty mak- ing decisions. When patients want your help in this area, you will ask them to list the advantages and disadvantages of each option and then help them devise a system for weighing each item and drawing a conclu- sion about which option seems best (see Figure 15.1). Therapist:\u2002 You mentioned that you wanted help in deciding whether to go to summer school or to get a job? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. (Pulls out a piece of paper.) Let me show you how to weigh advantages and disadvantages. Have you ever done that? Patient:\u2002 No. At least not in writing. \u00adI\u2019ve been going over some of the pros and cons in my head. Therapist:\u2002 Good. That\u2019ll help us get started. I think you\u2019ll find that writing them down will make the decision clearer. Which one do you want to start with\u2014school or a job? Patient:\u2002 Getting a job, I guess.  Additional Techniques 259 Therapist:\u2002 Okay. Write \u201cAdvantages of job\u201d at the top left of this paper and \u201cDisadvantages of job\u201d on the top right, and \u201cAdvantages of summer school\u201d and \u201cDisadvantages of summer school\u201d at the bot- tom.

Patient:\u2002 (Does so.) Okay. Therapist:\u2002 What have you been thinking? Could you jot down some advantages and disadvantages of getting a job? (Sally writes down the ideas she has had so far. I ask some questions to guide her.) How about the fact that you\u2019d be doing something different\u2014taking a break from schoolwork\u2014is that an advantage? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. (Writes it down.) Therapist:\u2002 Would a job cut into your vacation time? Patient:\u2002 No, I\u2019d only take a job that would let me spend the last 2 weeks of August with my family. Sally and I continue this process until she feels she has recorded both sides fairly and thoroughly. We repeat the process with the second option. Examining advantages and disadvantages of summer school reminds Sally of additional items to add to the \u201cjob\u201d lists. Likewise, she also reviews the \u201cjob\u201d items to see whether their counterparts are relevant to the \u201csummer school\u201d lists. Next, I help Sally evaluate the items: Advantages of job Disadvantages of job 1.\t Make money. 2.\t Maybe learn skills. 3.\t Break from what \u00adI\u2019ve been doing. 4.\t Meet different people. 5.\t Make me feel more productive. 6.\t Good for resum\u00e9. 1.\t Have to find one. 2.\t Less free time. 3.\t Might not like it. Advantages of summer school Disadvantages of summer school 1.\t Two friends are going. 2.\t Could take one less course in the\u00a0\u00adfall. 3.\t Lots of free time. 4.\t It\u2019s a known \u00adquantity. 5.\t Could meet new \u00adpeople. 6.\t Easier to enroll than to find a job. 1.\t Not making money and it costs money. 2.\t Doesn\u2019t increase my skills. 3.\t More of the same of what \u00adI\u2019ve been doing. 4.\t Doesn\u2019t make me feel as productive. 5.\t Doesn\u2019t help my resum\u00e9. FIGURE 15.1.\u2002 Sally\u2019s advantages\u2013disadvantages analysis. 260 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 Okay, this looks pretty complete. Now you need to weigh the items in some way. Do you want to circle the most important items\u2014or rate the importance of each one on a 1\u201310 scale? Patient:\u2002 Circle the items, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, let\u2019s look at the \u201cjob\u201d lists. Which items are most important to you? (Sally circles items in each column in Figure 15.1.) Just looking over what \u00adyou\u2019ve circled, what do you think? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019d like to get a job, because if I had one, I\u2019d make money and feel productive, and it would be good to get a break from school. ",

But it feels like it would be really hard to get one. Therapist:\u2002 Should we spend a few minutes now talking about how you might go about looking for a job? Then we can come back to this list and see if you\u2019re still leaning that way. At the end of the discussion, I increase the probability that Sally will use this technique again: Therapist:\u2002 Did you find this [process of listing and weighing advan- tages and disadvantages] useful? Can you think of any other deci- sions you might have to make where it would be good to do the same thing? How will you remember to do it this way? Refocusing As described in Chapter 11, it is often best for patients to evaluate their automatic thoughts on the spot and evaluate them or read relevant therapy notes. In some situations, however, this strategy is unfeasible or undesirable, and refocusing their attention is indicated. Refocusing is particularly useful when concentration is needed for the task at hand, such as completing a work assignment, carrying on a conversation, or driving. It is also useful when patients are having obsessive thoughts for which rational evaluation is ineffective. You will teach patients to label and accept their experience: \u201cI\u2019m just having automatic thoughts. I can accept the fact that I\u2019m having them and that I\u2019m feeling badly and refocus on what I was doing.\u201d Then patients should deliberately turn their attention to the report they are writing, to what their fellow conversationalists are saying, to the road ahead. You will rehearse the strategy with them, trying to elicit how they have refocused their atten- tion in the past or how they believe they could in the future. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, so one alternative when you\u2019re feeling anxious in class is to answer back those thoughts. But sometimes you may be  Additional Techniques 261 better off just changing your focus to what\u2019s going on in class. Have you done this before, made an effort to concentrate on the class? Patient:\u2002 Ah\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. yeah, I guess so. Therapist:\u2002 How did you do that? Patient:\u2002 Well, it helps if I start taking lots of notes. Therapist:\u2002 Good. ",

How about this week if you try not to let yourself just feel overwhelmed by your negative thoughts and anxiety and sad- ness, but instead either answer back your thoughts, or refocus and take lots of notes, or both. Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 How will you remember to do that? At other times, patients may be too distressed to refocus their attention on a task, or may not have a specific task to which to attend. Distracting activities can be useful in these circumstances. While dis- traction is not the ultimate solution, it can be a helpful short-term tech- nique. Again, elicit what has worked for the patient in the past and then offer other suggestions, if needed. Therapist:\u2002 So you got really worked up about the report you have to write? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I \u00adcouldn\u2019t concentrate. I just got more and more anx- ious. Therapist:\u2002 What did you do? Patient:\u2002 I just started to pace around my room. Therapist:\u2002 Did that help? Patient:\u2002 Not really. Therapist:\u2002 Did you try to answer back your thoughts? Patient:\u2002 I read my therapy notes, but they \u00addidn\u2019t help. I \u00addidn\u2019t believe them, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 (Jots down a note.) Let\u2019s try to figure out why they \u00adweren\u2019t helpful in a few minutes, but first let me ask you, how long were you anxious? Patient:\u2002 A long time. I \u00addon\u2019t know, maybe a couple of hours. I kept going back to my desk to try to read, but I just \u00adcouldn\u2019t. Therapist:\u2002 Did you try to distract yourself? Patient:\u2002 No. I finally decided not to try and I just went to dinner. Therapist:\u2002 Do you ever try to distract yourself? What have you done? Patient:\u2002 Usually, I turn on the TV. 262 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 How well does that usually work? Patient:\u2002 Sometimes I can lose myself and feel better, sometimes not. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, if it \u00addoesn\u2019t work well, what else do you try? Patient:\u2002 Sometimes I pick up the newspaper or do a crossword puzzle, but that \u00addoesn\u2019t always work either. Therapist:\u2002 Any other ideas? Patient:\u2002 .\u2009.\u2009.

No, not really. Therapist:\u2002 Can I mention some things that other people find helpful? You might try some of these things as an experiment this week: take a walk or go running, call or e-mail a friend or someone in your family, clean your closet or desk, balance your checkbook, go to the grocery store, knock on a neighbor\u2019s door, play a video game, visit your favorite websites\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. What do you think? Do you want to try any of these things this week? Patient:\u2002 Yes. I could do that. Therapist:\u2002 Sometimes people find that soothing activities are better: taking a long bath, listening to uplifting music, reading prayers. What do you think? Would you like to write down a few possibili- ties? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 Once you\u2019re feeling less distressed, you may be able to answer your thoughts better, or just return to what you were doing. Now, ultimately, we \u00addon\u2019t want you to have to distract yourself. But it may help for now. On the other hand, you may find that patients are distracting themselves too much. If they do not fear negative emotion, the follow- ing type of discussion can be useful. Therapist:\u2002 So, what you\u2019re saying is that you tend to try to push your thoughts out of your mind when you\u2019re feeling upset? Is that right? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 And do these thoughts, for example, that you \u00adcan\u2019t do something, vanish from your mind completely? Patient:\u2002 No, they usually come back. Therapist:\u2002 So you\u2019re not really pushing them completely out of mind, just to the back of your mind, where they wait for another opportu- nity to pop out and make you miserable? Patient:\u2002 I guess so.  Additional Techniques 263 Therapist:\u2002 I wonder this week if you would be willing, at least some of the time, to stop distracting yourself and instead really work on these thoughts, evaluate them as \u00adyou\u2019ve been learning to do in ses- sion? Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 Even if it\u2019s impossible to do a Thought Record at the time, maybe you could do it as soon as you have a free moment. Patients may use distraction to avoid the experience of negative emotion. It is imperative for them to fully understand that they do not need to distract themselves because while feeling upset can feel pain- ful, it is not harmful. ",

Patients may use distraction to avoid the experience of negative emotion. It is imperative for them to fully understand that they do not need to distract themselves because while feeling upset can feel pain- ful, it is not harmful. If patients consistently distract themselves, they cannot learn this important lesson, and you may need to set up behav- ioral experiments to test their fears about experiencing strong affect. It may be beneficial for you to teach them the AWARE technique on page 197 (Beck & Emery, 1985), in which they are instructed to accept the anxiety, watch it, act with the anxiety, repeat these steps, and expect the best. Measuring Moods and Behavior Using the\u00a0Activity Chart For some patients, it is helpful to use the activity chart, not to schedule activities, but to monitor their moods while engaged in various activi- ties, to look for patterns of occurrence. For example, a patient with an anxiety disorder might fill in the boxes listing activities and rating lev- els of anxiety 0\u201310 (or mild, moderate, severe). A patient who is chroni- cally irritated or angry might do likewise with an anger scale. Using such a scale is particularly useful for patients who either do not seem to notice small to moderate shifts in affect, or patients who chronically over- or underestimate degrees of emotion. Patients with a problematic behavior such as binge eating, smok- ing, overspending, gambling, substance use, or angry outbursts might record all their activities to investigate patterns of occurrence, or might just record the maladaptive behaviors themselves. Relaxation and Mindfulness Many patients benefit from learning relaxation techniques, described in detail elsewhere (Benson, 1975; Davis, Eshelman, & McKay, 2008; Jacobson, 1974). There are several kinds of relaxation exercises, includ- 264 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND ing progressive muscle relaxation, imagery, and controlled breathing. Patients can obtain commercially produced relaxation tapes or you can follow a script and make a recording for them during the session. You should teach relaxation exercises in session, where you can deal with problems and assess efficacy. Be aware that some patients experi- ence a paradoxical arousal effect from relaxation exercises; they actu- ally become more tense and anxious (Barlow, 2002; Clark, 1989). As with all techniques, you will propose that patients try relaxation as an experiment; either it will help reduce anxiety or it will lead to anxious thoughts that can be evaluated. Mindfulness techniques help patients nonjudgmentally observe and accept their internal experiences, without evaluating or trying to change them. ",

Mindfulness techniques help patients nonjudgmentally observe and accept their internal experiences, without evaluating or trying to change them. A short summary of techniques, particularly for people with rumination, can be found in Leahy (2010). Mindfulness is cur- rently being integrated with cognitive behavior therapy for a number of problems, including psychiatric disorders, medical conditions, and stress (Chiesa & Serretti, 2010a, 2010b). For extended discussions of mindfulness, see Hayes and colleagues (2004); McCown, Reibel, and Micozzi (2010); Williams, Teasdale, Segal, and Kabat-Zinn (2007); and Kabat-Zinn (1990). Graded Task Assignments To reach a goal, it is usually necessary to accomplish a number of steps along the way. Patients tend to become overwhelmed when they focus on how far they are from a goal, instead of focusing on their current step. A graphic depiction of the steps is often reassuring (see Figure 15.2). Therapist:\u2002 Sally, it sounds like you get nervous just thinking about voluntarily talking in class, though it\u2019s something you want to be able to do. Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 I wonder how we could break it down into steps; for exam- ple, could you start by just asking a question after class, either to another student or to the professor? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. I guess I could do that. Therapist:\u2002 What could the next step be? (Guides Sally in identifying the steps presented in Figure 15.2.) Therapist:\u2002 Does it still seem scary to think about talking in class? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, some.  Additional Techniques 265 Therapist:\u2002 (Draws a staircase.) Okay, here\u2019s what you have to remem- ber. You\u2019re going to start down here, doing something that\u2019s just a little hard, and you\u2019ll get really comfortable on this step before trying the next step, and so on. And remember, before you try the final step, you\u2019ll have gotten really good at the step just below it. Okay? Patient:\u2002 Uh-huh. Therapist:\u2002 So every time you start thinking about the final goal, how about reminding yourself of this staircase and especially of the step you\u2019re now on, and how you\u2019re going to go up the staircase one step at a time. Do you think that\u2019ll help bring down the anxiety? Exposure Depressed and anxious patients often engage in avoidance, a coping strategy. They may feel hopeless about engaging in certain activities (\u201cIt \u00adwon\u2019t do any good to call my friends. They \u00adwon\u2019t want to see me\u201d) or fearful (\u201cIf I [do this activity], something bad will happen\u201d). ",

Or the avoidance may be more subtle (e.g., socially anx- ious patients who avoid making eye contact, smiling at others, making small talk, and volunteering their opinions). These latter avoidances are safety behaviors (Salkovskis, 1996) that patients believe will ward off anxiety. While avoidance tends to bring immediate relief (and so is quite reinforcing), it perpetuates the problem. Patients do not get the opportunity to test their automatic thoughts and receive disconfirming data. When patients are anxious and significantly avoidant, you will pro- vide a strong rationale for exposing themselves to feared situations. Help them identify an activity that is associated with low to moderate discomfort and ask them to engage in this activity every day (or even several times a day, if feasible), until their anxiety has decreased signifi- cantly. Then identify a new situation that is just a little more difficult, and encourage frequent exposure until they can do it with relative ease, and so on. You may discuss various coping techniques to use before, during, and after each task: Thought Records, coping cards, or relaxation exer- cises, for example. For particularly avoidant patients, covert rehearsal (pages 303\u2013305) to identify either dysphoric automatic thoughts or excuses not to do an assignment is useful. In addition, you may find that patients are more likely to do daily work on a graded exposure hierarchy if you ask them to fill out a daily monitor, which can be sim- ple, listing just the date, activity, and level of anxiety, or it can be more elaborate (see Figure 15.3). In a more elaborate monitor, you can also ask patients to record and then cross off predictions that did not come true, a task that further reminds them of the inaccuracy of many of their thoughts. Detailed descriptions of the process used to develop agoraphobic hierarchies can be found in various sources (e.g.",

Additional Techniques 267 Dobson and Dobson (2009) describe plans for effective exposure ses- sions, possible targets, and factors that decrease the effectiveness of exposure. Role-Playing Role-playing is a technique that can be used for a wide variety of pur- poses. Descriptions of role-playing can be found throughout this vol- ume, including role-playing to uncover automatic thoughts, to develop an adaptive response, and to modify intermediate and core beliefs. Role-playing is also useful in learning and practicing social skills. Some patients have weak social skills in general, or are proficient at one style of communication but lack skills to adapt their style when needed. Sally, for example, is reasonably good at normal social conver- sation and situations that call for a caring, empathic stance. She is far less skilled, however, in situations in which assertion is appropriate. She and I engaged in a number of role plays to practice assertiveness. Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t even know how I\u2019d begin to talk to my professor. Therapist:\u2002 Well, you want him to help you understand this concept better, right? What would you like to say? Patient:\u2002 .\u2009.\u2009. I \u00addon\u2019t know. Therapist:\u2002 Well, how about if we do a role play. I\u2019ll be you; you play your professor. You can play him as being as unreasonable as you\u2019d like. Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019ll start: Uh, Professor X, could you explain this concept? Patient:\u2002 (gruffly) I did that already last week in class. \u00adWeren\u2019t you there? Therapist:\u2002 Actually, I was. But I \u00addon\u2019t understand it well enough yet. Patient:\u2002 Well, you should go read the chapter in your textbook. \u00adTherapist:\u2002 I\u2019ve done that already. It \u00addidn\u2019t help enough either. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here now. Patient:\u2002 Okay, what \u00addon\u2019t you understand about it? Therapist:\u2002 I tried to think of a specific question before I came, but I \u00adcouldn\u2019t quite think of how to phrase it. Could you spend a couple of minutes just describing it, and then I can see if I can put it in my own words? ",

Why \u00addon\u2019t you see someone else in the class? Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019d rather get it straight from you. That\u2019s why I came now during office hours. But if you\u2019d rather, I could come back on Thursday when you have office hours again. Patient:\u2002 This is a simple concept. You should really ask some other student. Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019ll try that first. If I need more help, I\u2019ll come back Thurs- day\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Okay, out of role. Let\u2019s review what I did and then we can switch roles. Before teaching patients social skills, you should assess the level of skill they already possess. Many patients know precisely what to do and say, but have difficulty using this knowledge because of dysfunctional assumptions (e.g., \u201cIf I express an opinion, I\u2019ll get shot down\u201d; \u201cIf I assert myself, the other person will be hurt/get mad/think I\u2019m out of line\u201d). One way of assessing skills is to have patients assume a positive outcome: \u201cIf you knew for sure the teaching assistant would be will- ing to talk to you, what would you say?\u201d \u201cIf you really believed it was your right to get help, what would you say?\u201d \u201cIf you knew the professor would back down and realize he was being unreasonable, what would you say?\u201d Another indication that the problem is associated with dysfunc- tional beliefs rather than with a skill deficit is the patient\u2019s use of these skills in another context. Patients may be quite appropriately assertive at work, for example, but not with friends. In this case, you might not need to use role-playing to teach assertiveness skills (although you could use role-playing to have the patients identify their automatic thoughts while they are being assertive, or to predict thoughts and feelings of the other person when roles are switched). Using the \u201cPie\u201d Technique It is often helpful to patients to see their ideas in graphic form. A pie chart can be used in many ways, for instance, helping patients set goals or determining relative responsibility for a given outcome, both of which are illustrated below (see Figure 15.4). ",

Setting Goals When patients have difficulty specifying their problems and the changes they would like to make in their lives, or when they lack insight into how  Additional Techniques 269 imbalanced their lives are, they may benefit from a graphic depiction of their ideal versus actual expenditure of time. Therapist:\u2002 It sounds as if you know your life \u00adisn\u2019t quite in balance, but you \u00addon\u2019t know what to change\u2014is that right? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I guess so. Therapist:\u2002 How about we draw a pie diagram to help figure it out? Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 First, we\u2019ll create a diagram of your life now, then an ideal one. Think about how much time you are actually spending in these areas: Work Friends Fun Family Other interests Taking care of your physical self Taking care of your household Taking care of your spiritual/ cultural/intellectual side Therapist:\u2002 Can you draw a pie and put in divisions to give me a rough idea of how you\u2019re spending your time now? Patient:\u2002 (Does so.)

Patient:\u2002 Well\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I guess I\u2019d work less, probably try to have more fun\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. spend more time with friends, exercise more, read more, things like that. Therapist:\u2002 Good. How would that look on this ideal pie? Patient:\u2002 (Fills in \u201cideal\u201d pie.) [expressing an automatic thought] But I\u2019m afraid if I spend less time working, I\u2019ll accomplish even less than I am now. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, let\u2019s write down that prediction. Now, you may be right, in which case you could always go back to the amount of work you\u2019re doing now. Or you may be wrong. It\u2019s possible if you work a little less and do more pleasurable things, your mood will improve. If your mood improves, is it possible that you might concentrate better and work more efficiently? What do you think? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure. Therapist:\u2002 In any case, we can test your prediction and see what hap- pens.

Following a discussion such as this, you would work with patients to set specific goals to move their expenditure of time closer to their ideal. Determining Responsibility Another technique allows the patient to see graphically the possible causes for a given outcome (see Figure 15.5). Therapist:\u2002 Sally, how much do you believe you got a C on your exam because you\u2019re basically incompetent? Patient:\u2002 Oh, close to 100%. Therapist:\u2002 I wonder if there might be any other reasons? Patient:\u2002 .\u2009.\u2009. Well, there were some things on it that we had never really covered in class. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, anything else?  Additional Techniques 271 Patient:\u2002 I missed two classes, so I had to borrow notes, and Lisa\u2019s notes \u00adweren\u2019t that good. Therapist:\u2002 Anything else? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. I studied some things a lot that turned out not to be on the exam. Therapist:\u2002 Sounds like you \u00adweren\u2019t very lucky in that regard. Patient:\u2002 No, and I hardly studied other things that were on the exam. I guessed wrong.

Therapist:\u2002 Would you say the professor had done a really good job of explaining the material? Patient:\u2002 No. I \u00addon\u2019t think he did a great job.

Here\u2019s a pie chart; let\u2019s have you divide up sections to explain why you got a C on the exam, including (1) the professor \u00addidn\u2019t teach that great; (2) the test was really hard; (3) you \u00adhadn\u2019t guessed right about which material to study; (4) you borrowed class notes that \u00adweren\u2019t great; (5) there was material on the exam that \u00adwasn\u2019t even covered in class; (6) your depression and anxiety interfered with your con- centration; and (7) at heart, you\u2019re an incompetent person. Patient:\u2002 (Fills in pie diagram [Figure 15.5].) Therapist:\u2002 Looks like you divided up the sections pretty evenly. How much do you believe now that you got a C on the exam because you\u2019re an incompetent person? Patient:\u2002 Less. 50%, maybe. Therapist:\u2002 Good. That\u2019s quite a drop. 272 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND When investigating the contribution of alternative explanations, ask patients to estimate the dysfunctional attribution (in this case, \u201cI\u2019m incompetent\u201d) last so they will more fully consider all explanations. Self-Comparisons and Credit Lists Patients with psychiatric disorders have a negative bias in information processing, especially when evaluating themselves. They tend to notice data that could be construed as negative and to ignore, discount, or even forget information that is positive. In addition, they often make dysfunctional comparisons: They compare themselves at present with how they were before the onset of their disorder, or with how they would like to be, or they compare themselves with others who do not have a psychiatric disorder. This negative attentional bias helps to maintain or increase their dysphoria. Changing the Self-Comparison In the following transcript, I help Sally see that her selective negative attention and comparisons are dysfunctional. I then teach her to make more functional comparisons (with herself at her worst point) and to keep a credit list. #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #7 Incompetence Teacher didn\u2019t teach great Test was hard Bad luck Borrowed class notes Some material not covered in class Depression and anxiety decreased concentration FIGURE 15.5.\u2002 Pie chart for causality.

Patient:\u2002 All of them. Therapist:\u2002 In how many did you take notes? Patient:\u2002 All of them. Therapist:\u2002 Was that easy to do? Or did you have to push yourself to go and concentrate? Patient:\u2002 It was hard. But I should have been able to do it easily. No one else probably had to push. Therapist:\u2002 Oh\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Sounds as if you might be comparing yourself with other people again. Do you do that a lot? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, I guess so. Therapist:\u2002 Does that seem like a fair comparison to you? Would you be as hard on yourself, for example, if you had to push yourself to go to class and concentrate if you had pneumonia? Patient:\u2002 No, I\u2019d have a legitimate reason to be tired. Therapist:\u2002 Exactly. I wonder if you have a legitimate reason to be tired now? Maybe you do deserve credit when you push yourself. Do you remember at the first session when we talked about the symptoms of depression: tiredness, low energy, trouble concentrating, distur- bances in sleep and appetite, and so on? Patient:\u2002 Uh-huh. Therapist:\u2002 So maybe you do deserve credit for pushing ahead, given that you are depressed? Patient:\u2002 I \u00adhadn\u2019t thought of it that way. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, let\u2019s go over two things now: what to do when you compare yourself with others, and how to keep track of what you deserve credit for. Okay, what happens to your mood when you compare yourself to others, for example, when you think, \u201cNo one else has to push to go to class and take notes?\u201d Patient:\u2002 I feel pretty bad. 274 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 And what would happen if you said to yourself, \u201cNow wait a minute. That\u2019s not a reasonable comparison. Let me compare myself to me at my worst point, when I was in my room a lot and \u00adcouldn\u2019t concentrate in class.\u201d Patient:\u2002 Well, I\u2019d realize that I\u2019m doing more now.

Then remind myself this \u00adisn\u2019t reasonable, and compare myself to me at my worst point instead.\u201d Patients may also have automatic thoughts in which they compare themselves at present to where they would like to be (e.g., \u201cI should be able to read this chapter easily\u201d), or to where they were before they became depressed (e.g., \u201cThis used to be so easy for me\u201d). In this case, help them focus on how far they have progressed since their worst point, rather than on far they are from their best point or on how far they have to go. When patients are at their lowest point, you will modify the approach: Therapist:\u2002 It sounds as if you feel pretty down when you compare yourself with other people, or with how you wish you were. I won- der if it might be helpful at these times to remind yourself that you have a goal list, and that together we\u2019re developing a plan to help you make changes. If you reminded yourself that you and I are a team working to get you to where you want to be, what could hap- pen to your mood? Credit Lists Credit lists are simply daily lists (mental or written) of positive things the patient is doing or items she deserves credit for (see Figure 15.6). As with all assignments, I first explain the rationale: Therapist:\u2002 Sally, I\u2019d like to describe a homework assignment that I think could help. You know, \u00adwe\u2019ve talked about how you have lots and lots of self-critical thoughts. And what happens to your mood every time you have a thought like, \u201cI should be doing this better,\u201d or \u201cI did a lousy job on that\u201d?  Additional Techniques 275 Patient:\u2002 I feel worse. Therapist:\u2002 Right. And what would happen, do you think, if you started noticing more good things you\u2019re doing? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019d probably feel better. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, now would you say that it would be reasonable for me to give myself credit if I were tired from either pneumonia or depression, but I pushed ahead anyway and got out of bed and came to work and saw my patients and wrote e-mails and so on? Patient:\u2002 Sure. Therapist:\u2002 Even if I \u00addidn\u2019t do these things as well as usual? Patient:\u2002 Well, sure. ",

(Things that I did that were positive or were a little hard but I did them anyway) 1.\t Tried to follow what was said in statistics class. 2.\t Finished paper and e-mailed it to [the professor]. 3.\t Talked to Julie at lunch. 4.\t Called Jeremy to confirm chemistry assignment. 5.\t Went for a run instead of taking a nap. 6.\t Read Chapter 5 of econ book.

Now on this list you can either just write positive things \u00adyou\u2019ve done, or you can think to yourself, \u201cWhat did I do today that was even a little hard, but I did it anyway?\u201d Patient:\u2002 Okay. (Writes down instructions.) Therapist:\u2002 Let\u2019s start with today. What have you already done today? Patient:\u2002 (Writes as she speaks.) Let\u2019s see, I went to my statistics class\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. it was kind of hard to follow, but I tried\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009.

How do you feel about doing this every day? Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 I think that you\u2019ll remember things ten times better if you write them down immediately. But if you \u00adcan\u2019t, you might at least try to write things down at lunch, dinner, and before bed. Think you can do that? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 Do you think you need to write down why you\u2019re doing this assignment? Patient:\u2002 No, I\u2019ll remember. ",

Completing credit lists early in treatment also helps prepare patients for the later task of uncovering positive data for the Core Belief Work- sheet (Chapter 11). In summary, there are many cognitive and behavioral techniques; this volume describes some of the most common. Readers are encour- aged to do additional reading to add to their repertoire.  277 Chapter 16 ImAGERY m any patients experience automatic thoughts not only as unspoken words in their mind, but also in the form of mental pictures or images (Beck & Emery, 1985). Sally had the thought \u201c[My classmate] will think I\u2019m imposing on him if I ask [for a copy of his notes].\u201d Upon questioning, I determined that when Sally experienced this thought, she simultaneously envisioned her classmate with an irritated look on his face. This image was an imaginal automatic thought. This chapter demonstrates how to teach patients to identify their spontaneous images and how to intervene therapeutically with both spontaneous and induced images. Although many patients have visual images, few report them. Merely asking about images, even repeatedly, sometimes is not suffi cient to elicit them. Images usually are quite brief and are often upsetting; many patients push them out of mind quite quickly. Failure to identify and respond to upsetting images may result in continued distress for the patient. IDENTIfYING ImAGES You will need to be alert to the possibility of patients\u2019 thoughts occur- ring in imaginal form, because few patients spontaneously report images and some have diffi culty identifying them even when prompted. In the following transcript, I try to ascertain whether Sally has had a spontaneous image simultaneous with a verbal automatic thought. 278 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 So you had the thought \u201cI \u00adwon\u2019t be able to handle a part- time job,\u201d and you felt sad? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 I wonder, when you had that thought, did you get a picture in your head? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure what you mean. Therapist:\u2002 Did \u201cnot handling\u201d a job look like something? Patient:\u2002 I guess I pictured myself walking back to my dorm late at night, just feeling overwhelmed and kind of burdened. Therapist:\u2002 Anything else? Patient:\u2002 I was walking really slowly, just feeling exhausted, with a really heavy backpack. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. ",

Therapist:\u2002 Anything else? Patient:\u2002 I was walking really slowly, just feeling exhausted, with a really heavy backpack. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. That picture, or imagining, is what we call an image. At times, patients fail to grasp the concept when the therapist only uses the word \u201cimage.\u201d Synonyms include mental picture, daydream, fantasy, imagining, and memory. Had Sally failed to report an image, I might have tried using one of these different words. Or I might have chosen to help her create an image (if a therapeutic goal for that ses- sion was to help her recognize images). I could have induced a neu- tral or positive image (\u201cDescribe for me what the outside of your home looks like,\u201d or \u201cImagine you\u2019re walking into this building. What do you see?\u201d). Or I might have tried to induce an image about a distressing situation, as below: Therapist:\u2002 Did you imagine what your professor might look like when you asked him for help? Did he look happy? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t think I pictured what he looked like. Therapist:\u2002 [helping Sally to think very specifically] Could you pic- ture it now? Can you imagine going up to him? When would you approach him, anyway? Patient:\u2002 Oh, probably on Tuesday. That\u2019s when he has office hours. Therapist:\u2002 So he\u2019d be in his office? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 What building is he in? Patient:\u2002 Bennett Hall. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, can you picture it now? It\u2019s Tuesday, you\u2019re coming up to Bennett Hall\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. You\u2019re coming to his office\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Can you see it in your mind? Is the door open or closed?  Imagery 279 Patient:\u2002 Closed. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, can you see yourself knocking on the door? What does he say when he hears your knock? Patient:\u2002 He says, \u201cCome in.\u201d (Imitates professor\u2019s gruff voice.)

Okay, this scene \u00adyou\u2019ve just visualized is what we call an \u201cimage.\u201d Do you think you might have had an image like this when you were considering going to see him this week?

Educating Patients about Imagery Some patients can identify images, but do not report them because their images are graphic and distressing. They may be reluctant to reex- perience the distress or fear you will view them as disturbed. If you suspect either scenario, normalize the experience of images. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, I \u00addon\u2019t know whether you are having images. Most people do, but usually they\u2019re more aware of the emotion that accompanies the image than they are of the image itself. Some- times images seem pretty strange, but actually it\u2019s common to have all kinds of images\u2014sad, scary, even violent ones. The only prob- lem is if you think you\u2019re strange for having the images. Can you recall any images \u00adyou\u2019ve had recently? Patient:\u2002 No, I \u00addon\u2019t think so. Therapist:\u2002 Well, \u00adwe\u2019ve agreed this week that you\u2019re going to be on the lookout for images when you notice your mood changing. If you are having distressing images, I\u2019ll teach you what you can do about them. Normalizing and teaching patients about images helps reduce their anxiety and makes it more likely that they will be able to identify their images. In the previous transcript, I indicate that Sally will learn 280 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND to respond to images, implying that she can gain control over her dis- tress. You must often be diligent in teaching patients to identify images until they \u201ccatch on.\u201d Most patients simply are unaware of images ini- tially, and many therapists, after a few tries, abandon the attempt. If you get a visual image yourself as the patient is describing a situation, you can use the image as a cue to probe further for an image your patient may have experienced: Therapist:\u2002 Sally, as you were just describing how you\u2019re afraid your roommate will react, I got a picture of her in my head, even though I \u00addon\u2019t know her. Have you been imagining how she might look when you bring up the problem of noise with her? Responding to Spontaneous Images When patients do have distressing images, there are several strategies you can teach them. The first seven techniques help patients reduce their distress by viewing a situation in a different way; the last one offers temporary respite by having the patient focus on something else. ",

Responding to Spontaneous Images When patients do have distressing images, there are several strategies you can teach them. The first seven techniques help patients reduce their distress by viewing a situation in a different way; the last one offers temporary respite by having the patient focus on something else. It is important for you to advise patients that they will need to practice the techniques in and out of session to use them effectively. Following Images to Completion This technique is often the most helpful. It can help you and patients conceptualize their problem better, lead to cognitive restructuring of the image, and provide relief. You will encourage patients to continue visualizing a spontaneous image until one of two things occurs: Either patients imagine getting through a crisis and feeling better, or they imagine an ultimate catastrophe, such as death. (In the latter case, you can then explore the feared consequences and meaning of the ultimate catastrophe and intervene further.) The first transcript illustrates the first scenario; the patient imagines getting through a particular dif- ficulty. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, Sally, can you get that image in mind again? Tell it to me aloud as you imagine it as vividly as you can. Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m sitting in class. My professor is passing out the exam. I\u2019m looking at it. My mind is going blank. I read the first question. Noth- ing is making sense. I see everyone else busy writing. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cI\u2019m paralyzed. I\u2019m going to fail.\u201d  Imagery 281 Therapist:\u2002 And you\u2019re feeling\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009? Patient:\u2002 Really, really anxious. Therapist:\u2002 Anything else happen? Patient:\u2002 No. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. [providing psychoeducation] This is very typical. \u00adYou\u2019ve stopped the image at the very worst point, where you\u2019re feel- ing blank and paralyzed. Now I\u2019d like you to imagine what hap- pens next. Patient:\u2002 Hmmm. I\u2019m not sure. Therapist:\u2002 Well, do you stay that way for the whole hour? Patient:\u2002 No, I guess not. Therapist:\u2002 Can you picture what happens next?\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. If you\u2019re look- ing around and seeing the other students, are you actually para- lyzed? Patient:\u2002 No, I guess not.

The first question \u00addoesn\u2019t make any sense to me. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, then what? Patient:\u2002 I skip to the next question. I\u2019m not sure of the answer. Therapist:\u2002 Then what?

Therapist:\u2002 And then? Patient:\u2002 I sit down, get out the right notebook. Therapist:\u2002 And how are you feeling in the image now? Patient:\u2002 A little shaky still. I \u00addon\u2019t know how I did on the exam. Therapist:\u2002 Better than at the start when you were feeling blank and paralyzed? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Much better. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Let\u2019s review what you did. First, you recognized a distressing image, which you stopped at the absolute worst point. Then you kept imagining what would realistically happen next until you got to the point where you were feeling somewhat better. This is what we call \u201cfollowing the image to completion.\u201d (pause) Do you think it would help to practice this technique? In the previous example, the patient is easily able to identify a rea- sonable outcome. In some cases, the therapist needs to suggest a modi- fication of the scene: Therapist:\u2002 Can you picture what happens next?\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. If you\u2019re looking around and seeing the other students, are you actually paralyzed? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. I feel paralyzed. Therapist:\u2002 What do you see happening next? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. I just keep sitting there, feeling paralyzed. Therapist:\u2002 Do you want to imagine yourself moving around a little in the chair, taking a breath, looking out the window? Patient:\u2002 Uh-huh. Therapist:\u2002 Do you want to rub the back of your neck and stretch, to make yourself less stiff? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, are you ready now in the image to read through the test until something seems familiar? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 Are you picturing that? What do you want to imagine hap- pens next? Patient:\u2002 I find an easier question. Therapist:\u2002 What do you want to imagine happens next?  ",

Imagery 283 Here I introduce a new element into the image to help Sally get \u201cunstuck\u201d and repeatedly ask her what she wants to imagine. I continue in this vein until she can continue on her own. As mentioned above, sometimes the patient imagines a scene that worsens, often catastrophically. The therapist then asks questions to determine the meaning of the catastrophe and intervenes accordingly. This situation is exemplified by a different patient, Marie. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, Marie, so you see yourself in the car and it\u2019s starting to drift toward the guard rail of the bridge. Now, get as clear a pic- ture in your mind as you can. Then what happens? Patient:\u2002 It\u2019s getting closer. It crashes through. (Cries softly.) Therapist:\u2002 (gently) Then what? Patient:\u2002 (crying) The car is totally wrecked. Therapist:\u2002 (softly) And you? Patient:\u2002 (crying) I\u2019m dead. Therapist:\u2002 Then what happens? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. I \u00adcan\u2019t see past that. (still crying) Therapist:\u2002 Marie, I think it\u2019ll help if we try to go a little further. What\u2019s the worst part about dying in this crash? Patient:\u2002 My kids. They \u00adwon\u2019t have a mother anymore. They\u2019ll be just devastated. (crying harder) Therapist:\u2002 (Waits a moment.) Do you have an image of them? In this example, following the image to completion leads to a catas- trophe. I keep gently questioning so I can determine the special sig- nificance of the catastrophe. A later example in this chapter, inducing images to provide distance, illustrates one way to deal with this type of problem. In this case, a patient reveals that she has had a new image, of her children at her funeral, feeling utterly devastated. Once again, the patient has cut off an image at the worst point. (See pages 292\u2013293 for an illustration of how the therapist will have the patient imagine her children [doing better] many years in the future.) In summary, two outcomes are possible when following an image to completion. In one instance, the problem is eventually resolved, and the patient feels relief. In the second instance, the problem worsens to a catastrophe, at which point you ask for the meaning of or the worst part about the image, which helps you uncover a new problem. You can then help the patient induce a coping image, described later in this chapter. ",

At this point, you might suggest that patients imag- ine themselves at some point in the near future. Therapist:\u2002 [summarizing] Okay, Sally, when you imagine getting started on this paper, you keep seeing how hard it is and how much effort it\u2019s taking and how many problems you\u2019re having with it. Realistically, do you think you\u2019ll eventually finish the paper? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, probably. I might have to work day and night for a long time, though. Therapist:\u2002 How about if you jump ahead in time and imagine finish- ing it. Can you picture that? What does that look like? Patient:\u2002 Well, I guess I see myself reading it over and making one last edit. Then I e-mail it to the professor. Therapist:\u2002 Wait a moment. Can you slow it down a little, really imag- ine the details? Patient:\u2002 Okay. I\u2019m sitting at my desk in my dorm room. It\u2019s like 2 o\u2019clock in the morning. It\u2019s hard to keep my eyes open, but I start at page 1 and proofread my work. I find a few mistakes and I fix them, then save it in a file. I open my e-mail and send it to my professor. Therapist:\u2002 How do you feel in the image now? Patient:\u2002 Relieved\u00a0 .\u2009.\u2009. like a weight has been taken off my chest. Lighter. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, let\u2019s review what we did. You had an image of your- self starting to work on this paper and the more you imagined, the more problems you saw and the more anxious you were getting. Then you jumped ahead in time and saw yourself finishing it, which made you feel better. How about if we have you write something down about this technique\u2014jumping ahead in time\u2014so you\u2019ll be able to practice it at home, too. Coping in the Image Another technique is to guide patients so they can imagine they are coping with a difficult situation they have spontaneously envisioned.

I guess I tell him, \u201cShh. There\u2019s another class in here.\u201d Therapist:\u2002 And then what? Patient:\u2002 He starts veering over to the books. Therapist:\u2002 So you .\u2009.\u2009. Patient:\u2002 I guess I take his hand and guide him to a table. The dialogue continues in this way until the patient has successfully coped in the image. If necessary, you can ask leading questions to help them devise solutions. (\u201cWould you like to imagine that.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009?\u201d) You can also guide patients to imagine themselves using tools they have learned in therapy: for example, reading a coping card, using controlled breath- ing, and saying self-instructions aloud. Changing the Image Another technique involves teaching patients to reimagine a sponta- neous image, changing the ending to alleviate their distress. The first example is a realistic change, the second, a \u201cmagical\u201d change. Patient:\u2002 This morning I was thinking about spring vacation. I \u00adcan\u2019t go home. I\u2019ll have to stay here. I was feeling really down about that. Therapist:\u2002 Did you have an image of what that would be like? Patient:\u2002 I was imagining myself just sitting at my desk, alone in my room, kind of slumped over, feeling really bad. Therapist:\u2002 Anything else? Patient:\u2002 No, just that it\u2019s so quiet. The dorm is deserted. Therapist:\u2002 And the image makes you feel .\u2009.\u2009. Patient:\u2002 Sad. Real sad. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, you \u00addon\u2019t have to be at the mercy of this image. You can change it, if you want. It\u2019s as if you\u2019re a movie director: You can decide how you want it to be instead. You can change it in a magical way\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. something that \u00adcouldn\u2019t really happen. Or you can change it to a realistic image. ",

Therapist:\u2002 Well, okay, you\u2019re sitting at your desk. What do you wish would happen next? Patient:\u2002 That my best friend calls me\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. or it turns out there are more people in the dorm and someone comes knocking on my door, and we go to dinner together. Therapist:\u2002 Any other scenario? Patient:\u2002 Maybe that I remember there\u2019s some event on campus, like a softball game, and I go watch or play. Therapist:\u2002 Those are much better endings. How do you think you\u2019d feel if you imagined those things happening? Patient:\u2002 Better. But how do I know they\u2019ll come true? Therapist:\u2002 Well, first of all, neither of us really knows if you\u2019ll actually end up sitting at your desk, crying. What we do know is imagining it makes you feel really sad now. Second, maybe we could talk about how to make it more likely that there really is a better ending. What could you do so your friend might call, or a dormmate might knock on your door, or you might go to a campus event? Changing the image in this case leads to a productive discussion involv- ing problem solving. Some images lend themselves to change that is more \u201cmagical\u201d in nature. Altering the image in this way also usually leads to a reduction in distress and allows the patient to act in a more productive way. An example follows: Therapist:\u2002 [summarizing, using Sally\u2019s own words] So you have an image of your professor standing very tall over you, scowling, speak- ing harshly, stomping his foot, being overbearing, and the image makes you very anxious? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 Would you like to change the image? Imagine him in a different way? Patient:\u2002 How? Therapist:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. He kind of reminds me of a 3-year-old hav- ing a tantrum. Can you imagine that he shrinks down in size but still is scowling, still stomping his foot? Patient:\u2002 (Smiles.) Yes. Therapist:\u2002 Describe him to me, in detail. (Patient does so.) And how do you feel now? As anxious?  Imagery 287 Patient:\u2002 No, less. Therapist:\u2002 Has it come down enough to let you go make an appoint- ment with him? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I think so. ",

Therapist:\u2002 Okay, let\u2019s review what we just did. We started with an image you had of your professor. It sounded as if this image was so dis- tressing that it stopped you from doing what you need to do\u2014make an appointment with him. Then you took control of the image by changing it and your anxiety came down, enough for you to go and meet with him. We call this technique \u201cchanging the image.\u201d Reality Testing the Image Here you teach patients to treat images like verbal automatic thoughts, using standard Socratic questioning. Therapist:\u2002 So you had an image of me frowning and looking disap- proving when you told me you \u00adhadn\u2019t done part of your home- work? Patient:\u2002 (Nods.) Therapist:\u2002 What\u2019s the evidence that I would frown and be disapprov- ing?\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. Do you have any evidence on the other side? In another situation, I teach Sally to compare a spontaneous image with what is really happening. Patient:\u2002 I was in the library late last night, and I had an image of the building being real deserted, and then I saw myself suddenly feel- ing really sick and passing out and having no one there to help me. Therapist:\u2002 Was it true that the library was completely deserted? Patient:\u2002 No. It was getting late, near closing time, but there were still a few people around. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. With this kind of image, when you\u2019re spontaneously imagining something happening right at the moment, you can do a reality check. You can ask yourself, \u201cIs the library deserted? Am I actually feeling really sick right now?\u201d If you had known to do that last night, what do you think would have happened to your mood? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019d have felt less nervous. 288 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND In general, it is preferable to use techniques in imagery form when dealing with images, rather than the verbal techniques suggested in this section. However, patients who have many vivid, distressing images will benefit from a variety of techniques, and sometimes the verbal technique of a reality check is helpful. Repeating the Image The repetition technique can be useful when patients are clearly imag- ining exaggerated outcomes. You suggest that they keep imagining the original image over and over again, paying attention to whether the image and their level of distress change. ",

Repeating the Image The repetition technique can be useful when patients are clearly imag- ining exaggerated outcomes. You suggest that they keep imagining the original image over and over again, paying attention to whether the image and their level of distress change. Some patients seem to do an automatic reality check, and envision each succeeding image more real- istically and with less dysphoria. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, Sally, so you had the image of asking your profes- sor for an extension, and he clearly got quite upset, yelling at you, bending over close to you, waving his hands wildly, saying, \u201cHow dare you! You knew when it was due. Get out!\u201d Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 I wonder, could you imagine this again? Start out the same way. See what happens. Patient:\u2002 (Closes eyes.) Therapist:\u2002 Finished? What happened? Patient:\u2002 He was pretty upset. He yelled at me, told me to get out. Therapist:\u2002 This time did he wave his hands, bend over too close to you? Patient:\u2002 No. He just stood up and stiffened his arms on his desk. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. Do the same thing again. I ask Sally to repeat the scene three or four times. By the last rep- etition, her image has changed quite a bit: The professor leans back in his chair, gives Sally an annoyed look, and says no in an unkind but nonthreatening way. Sally\u2019s anxiety diminishes significantly. Substituting Images Substituting a more pleasant image has been extensively described else- where (e.g., Beck & Emery, 1985). It, too, must be regularly practiced in order for the patient to experience relief from distressing spontaneous images:  Imagery 289 Therapist:\u2002 Sally, another way of dealing with this kind of upsetting image is to substitute a different one. Some people like to imagine that the distressing image is a picture on a television set. Then they imagine changing the channel to a different scene, like lying on a beach, or walking through the woods, or recalling a pleasant mem- ory. Would you like to try this technique? First, you\u2019ll picture the pleasant scene in as much detail as possible, using as many senses as possible; then I\u2019ll have you practice switching from a distressing image to the pleasant one. Now, what pleasant scene would you like to imagine? Inducing Imagery as a Therapeutic Tool At times, you will induce an image as opposed to help a patient respond to a spontaneous image. Covert rehearsal to uncover obstacles related to homework is one example (pages 303\u2013305). Three other induced imaginal techniques are described next. ",

Rehearsal of Coping Techniques You will use this technique to help patients practice using coping strate- gies in imagination. This technique differs from \u201ccoping in the image\u201d because here you induce an image rather than having patients imagine how they would cope in a spontaneous image. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, you\u2019re predicting that you\u2019re going to have a rough time giving the oral report in class. Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 When will you first notice your anxiety going up? Patient:\u2002 When I wake up. Therapist:\u2002 And what will be going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m going to mess up. And I\u2019ll picture myself stammering and stuttering and being unable to talk. Therapist:\u2002 You mean in class? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, what could you do? Patient:\u2002 Tell myself to relax. Remind myself \u00adI\u2019ve practiced this a lot. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, what then? Patient:\u2002 I could do some controlled breathing. That relaxes me some. 290 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 Okay, can you see yourself doing that? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 Then what? Patient:\u2002 I feel a little better, but I\u2019m still too nervous for breakfast. I just shower, get dressed, get ready to go. Therapist:\u2002 What\u2019s going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 What if I keep getting more and more nervous? Therapist:\u2002 How about imagining yourself reading the coping card [we made a few minutes ago] on the way to class? Can you imagine pulling it out and reading it? Patient:\u2002 Yeah\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. I guess it helps some. Therapist:\u2002 As you get near class, how about if you imagine jumping ahead in time. \u00adYou\u2019ve finished the talk, and now you\u2019re sitting there listening to someone else\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. How do you feel now? Patient:\u2002 Some relief. Still worried, but not as bad. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, now you\u2019re walking into class. What happens next, and what do you do? The patient continues imagining herself realistically coping with the situation in detail. Then she writes down the specific techniques she predicts will help. Distancing Distancing is another induced imagery technique to reduce distress and help patients see problems in greater perspective. In the follow- ing example, I help Sally see that her difficulties are likely to be time limited. ",

How about if you try to picture yourself a year from now? Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 Any idea what life is like? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard for me to think that far ahead.  Imagery 291 Therapist:\u2002 Well, let\u2019s be concrete. When do you wake up? Where are you? Patient:\u2002 Probably I wake up around 8:00 or 8:30. I guess I\u2019m in an off- campus apartment. Therapist:\u2002 Living alone? Patient:\u2002 Maybe in a house with other students, some people from my floor this year. \u00adWe\u2019ve been talking about it. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, you wake up. What happens next? Patient:\u2002 I probably rush off to class. It\u2019ll take longer to get there if I\u2019m not in a dorm. Therapist:\u2002 Do you see any of your housemates before you go? Do you go to class alone or with one of them? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. Therapist:\u2002 Well, it\u2019s your image. You decide. Patient:\u2002 Okay, I guess I\u2019d walk over with one of them. Therapist:\u2002 What do you talk about on the way\u2014or are you silent? Patient:\u2002 Oh no, we\u2019d be talking about school or people we know. Something like that. Therapist:\u2002 Then what? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019d go to class. Therapist:\u2002 A big lecture hall like most of your classes this year? Patient:\u2002 No, probably not, classes should be smaller next year. Therapist:\u2002 And what do you want to imagine happens in class? Do you interact or are you quiet? Patient:\u2002 Well, hopefully by then I\u2019d know more people. I\u2019d feel more comfortable. I\u2019d probably still be quiet, but I might be participat- ing more. Therapist:\u2002 How do you feel when you imagine this scene? Patient:\u2002 Good. Therapist:\u2002 How would you feel about finishing out this scene for homework? Then every time you have the thought, \u201cI\u2019ll never get out of this,\u201d you could try switching to this scene to see if it has an effect on your mood. Patient:\u2002 I\u2019ll try.

Patient:\u2002 That\u2019s true. 292 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Another distancing technique helps a patient deal with the imag- ined aftermath of a catastrophe. Marie, described previously, fears that her children would be devastated forever if she died. Her therapist has her imagine their realistic level of distress at different points in time, instead of just immediately after the accident. (This technique is simi- lar to jumping ahead in time; it involves the passage of years, though, instead of minutes, hours, or days.) Therapist:\u2002 Marie, who do you imagine breaks the news of your death to the kids? Patient:\u2002 My husband. Therapist:\u2002 How does he do it? Patient:\u2002 (sobbing) He puts his arms around them. He says, \u201cThere\u2019s been an accident. Mommy\u2019s gone.\u201d Therapist:\u2002 And then? Patient:\u2002 They \u00addon\u2019t believe it, not really, at first. They start crying and saying, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not true. I want Mommy.\u201d Therapist:\u2002 They\u2019re feeling pretty bad? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Real bad. Therapist:\u2002 (Waits a moment.) Can you jump ahead some? It\u2019s now 6 months later. What\u2019s going on now? Can you see them? Patient:\u2002 They\u2019re in school. Looking real sad. Bewildered. Kind of empty. Therapist:\u2002 How bad are they feeling? Patient:\u2002 Still pretty bad. Therapist:\u2002 Can we jump ahead 2 years? How old will they be? Patient:\u2002 Melissa will be 8. Linda will be 7. Therapist:\u2002 What do you see them doing? Patient:\u2002 Playing outside. It\u2019s our house. I \u00addon\u2019t think my husband would move. Therapist:\u2002 What are they playing? Patient:\u2002 They\u2019re jumping rope with the neighbor kids. Therapist:\u2002 How are they feeling now? Patient:\u2002 Okay, when they \u00addon\u2019t think about me. Therapist:\u2002 And when they do? Patient:\u2002 (Tears up.) They still cry sometimes. It\u2019s confusing. Therapist:\u2002 As bad as when they first found out? Patient:\u2002 No, not that bad.  Imagery 293 The therapist gently leads Marie through a succession of images 5, 10, and 20 years after her imagined death. Through this exercise, Marie is able to see that the initial devastation her daughters feel eventually subsides to briefer periods of sadness and grief with which they are able to cope. Imagining in detail that her daughters grow up and create new families of their own significantly reduces Marie\u2019s fear of her own death in an automobile accident. ",

Reduction of Perceived Threat A third type of induced image is designed to allow patients to view a situation with a more realistic assessment of actual threat. For example, I encouraged Sally to modify her image of her class presentation by imagining the encouraging faces of her friends in the room. Pam, a patient who feared undergoing a Caesarean section, envisioned all the life-saving equipment in the delivery room and the caring faces of the nurse and doctor behind their masks. In summary, many if not most patients experience automatic thoughts in the form of spontaneous images. Persistent (though nonin- trusive) questioning is often required to help patients recognize their images. Patients who do have frequent, distressing images benefit from regular practice of several imagery techniques. In addition, images may be induced for various therapeutic purposes.  294 Chapter 17 HOmEWORk H omework is an integral, not optional, part of cognitive behavior therapy (Beck et al., 1979). A number of researchers have found that cognitive behavior therapy patients who carry out homework assign- ments progress better in therapy than those who do not (e.g., Kazantzis, Whittington, & Datillio, 2010; Neimeyer & Feixas, 1990; Persons, Burns & Perloff, 1988). You seek to extend the opportunities for cognitive and behavioral change throughout the patient\u2019s week. You prepare the patient for doing homework in the fi rst session. TherapisT: Sally, I think it would be important for you to read this [statement about being depressed, not lazy] every day. Do you think you could do that? paTienT: Yes, I think so. TherapisT: In fact, reminding yourself of important things we talk about in session is one way you\u2019re going to get over your depres- sion. Another way is by changing some of the things that you do. We\u2019ve found that it\u2019s not enough for people to just come and talk. They need to make small changes in their thinking and behavior every day. paTienT: Okay. TherapisT: But we\u2019ll always make sure that you think the changes are a good idea and that you\u2019ll be able to do them. Now, what should we call these changes? Homework? Your action plan? Something else?  Homework 295 Patient:\u2002 Homework, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, but I want you to remember that this \u00adisn\u2019t like school homework. This is homework that you think will help, that we\u2019ll design together, just for you. ",

This is homework that you think will help, that we\u2019ll design together, just for you. Good homework assignments provide opportunities for patients to educate themselves further (e.g., through bibliotherapy), to collect data (e.g., through monitoring their thoughts, feelings, and behavior), to test their thoughts and beliefs, to modify their thinking, to practice cognitive and behavioral tools, and to experiment with new behaviors. Homework can maximize what was learned in a therapy session and lead to an increase in patients\u2019 sense of self-efficacy. Many patients do homework quite willingly and easily; a few do not. It is important to note that even the most experienced therapists encounter difficulty with an occasional patient who, despite careful preparation, rarely does any written assignments. Nevertheless, you should initially assume that any patient (unless he or she is very low functioning) will do homework if you set it up properly. To enhance the probability that patients will comply, you need to take care, for exam- ple, to: Tailor assignments to the individual, \u2022 Provide a sound rationale, \u2022 Uncover potential obstacles, and \u2022 Modify relevant beliefs. \u2022 This chapter is divided into four parts: 1.\t Setting homework assignments. 2.\t Increasing the likelihood of successful completion of home- work. 3.\t Conceptualizing problems. 4.\t Reviewing completed homework. Setting Homework Assignments There is no set formula for assigning homework. Rather, you tailor homework to the individual patient. How do you decide what to sug- gest? It depends on what you have discussed in session, which is influ- enced by your overall treatment plan and the patient\u2019s goals. You take 296 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND into consideration individual characteristics of patients: their reading and writing abilities, their motivation and willingness to comply with homework, their current level of distress and functioning (cognitive, emotional, and behavioral), and practical constraints (e.g., of time), to name a few. You may need to take the lead in suggesting homework assignments at the beginning of treatment but you begin, as soon as possible, to ask patients to devise their own assignments (e.g., \u201cNow that \u00adwe\u2019ve finished talking about this problem with your roommate, what do you think would be helpful for you to remember this week? To do this week?\u201d). Patients who routinely set their own homework by the end of therapy are more likely to continue doing so when treatment has ended. ",

In this first section, typical assignments are presented; then a sam- ple of Sally\u2019s homework assignments are provided. The final portion of this chapter offers guidelines for increasing homework adherence. Ongoing Homework Assignments Typical ongoing homework assignments are discussed below. 1. Behavioral activation. Getting inactive, depressed patients out of bed or off the couch and helping them resume their normal activities (and engage in new activities) is essential. Activity scheduling benefits other patients as well. 2. Monitoring automatic thoughts. From the first session forward, you will encourage your patients to ask themselves, \u201cWhat\u2019s going through my mind right now?\u201d when they notice their mood changing, and remind themselves that their thinking may or may not be true. Initially they may jot down their thoughts (in their smartphone, on their com- puter, or simply on paper, in a notebook, or on an index card). Advise patients that monitoring their automatic thoughts can lead them to feel worse, if they accept them uncritically, and that you will do problem solving with them if their thoughts do turn out to be valid. 3. Evaluating and responding to automatic thoughts. At virtually every session, you will help patients modify their inaccurate and dysfunc- tional thoughts and write down their new way of thinking. An essential homework assignment is to have them read these therapy notes on a regular basis. Patients will also learn to evaluate their own thinking and practice doing so between sessions. 4. Problem solving. At virtually every session, you will help patients devise solutions to their problems, which they will implement between sessions. 5. Behavioral skills. To effectively solve their problems, patients may need to learn new skills, which they will practice for homework. For  Homework 297 example, you might teach relaxation skills to anxious patients, asser- tiveness skills to socially anxious patients, or organizational and time management skills to patients who would benefit from them. 6. Behavioral experiments. Patients may need to directly test the valid- ity of automatic thoughts that seem distorted, such as \u201cI\u2019ll feel better if I stay in bed\u201d; \u201cMy roommate will get mad if I bring up the problem of noise\u201d; \u201cNo one will talk to me at the meeting.\u201d 7.

Bibliotherapy. Important concepts you are discussing in session can be greatly reinforced when patients read about them in black and white. It is usually valuable to have patients both read and note their reactions: what they agreed with, disagreed with, and had questions about. 8. Preparing for the next therapy session. The beginning part of each therapy session can be greatly speeded up if patients think about what is important to tell you before they enter your office. The Preparing for Therapy Worksheet (page 102) can help prepare them. A Sampling of Homework Assignments for Sally Some of the assignments below are helpful for almost any depressed patient; others were specifically designed for this particular patient. Session 1 Read this list twice a day; set an alarm to remember. 1.\t If I start thinking I\u2019m lazy and no good, remind myself that I have a real illness, called depression, that makes it harder for me to do things. As the treatment starts to work, my depression will lift, and things will get easier. 2.\t Read goal list and add others, if I think of any. 3.\t When I notice my mood getting worse, ask myself, \u201cWhat\u2019s going through my mind right now?\u201d and jot down the thoughts. Remind myself that just because I think something \u00addoesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s true. 4.\t Make plans with Allison and Joe. Remember, if they say no, it\u2019s likely that they\u2019d like to hang out with me but they\u2019re too busy. 5.\t Read Coping with Depression booklet (optional). Session 2 1.\t Daily: When I notice my mood changing, ask myself, \u201cWhat\u2019s going through my mind right now?\u201d and jot down my automatic thoughts (which may or may not be completely true). 2.\t If I \u00adcan\u2019t figure out my automatic thoughts, jot down just the situa- 298 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND tion. Remember, learning to identify my thinking is a skill I\u2019ll get better at, like typing. 3.\t Ask Sean for help with Chapter 5 of Econ book. 4.\t Daily: Read therapy notes. 5.\t Continue running/swimming. 6.\t Plan two to three social activities. 7.\t Daily: Add to credit list (anything I do that is even a little difficult but I do it anyway). 8.\t (Tuesday morning): Review Preparing for Therapy Worksheet for 2 minutes. Session 3 1.\t Daily: Read therapy notes. 2.\t ",

Session 12 (Penultimate Session) 1.\t Thought Record about termination. 2.\t Organize therapy notes from beginning. 3.\t Review notes on doing a self-therapy session. Increasing Homework Adherence Although some patients easily do the suggested assignments, home- work is more problematic for others. Implementation of the following guidelines increases the likelihood that patients will be successful with homework and experience an elevation in mood: 1.\t Tailor the assignment to the individual. (Be 90\u2013100% sure the patient can and will do the assignment.) Err on the side of devising assignments that are too easy rather than too hard. 2.\t Provide a rationale as to how and why the assignment might help. 3.\t Set homework collaboratively; seek the patient\u2019s input and agreement. 4.\t Make homework a no-lose proposition. 5.\t Begin the assignment (when possible) in session. 6.\t Help set up systems for remembering to do the assignment. 300 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND 7.\t Anticipate possible problems; do covert rehearsal when indicated. 8.\t ",

Tailoring Homework to the Individual Successful completion of homework can speed up therapy and lead to an increased sense of mastery and improved mood. Rather than sug- gesting assignments according to a prescribed formula, you should consider the patient\u2019s characteristics (mentioned in the introduction to this chapter) and desires. Matt, for example, was a patient who did not grasp the cognitive model in the first session and, indeed, became slightly irritated when his (novice) therapist kept pushing him to identify his automatic thoughts. He told his therapist, \u201cYou \u00addon\u2019t understand; I \u00addon\u2019t know what is going through my mind at the time; all I know is that I\u2019m very upset.\u201d A home- work assignment to jot down his automatic thoughts would have been inappropriate for this session. A second patient, Caitlin, on the other hand, had already read a popular book on cognitive behavior therapy and had an unusually good grasp of her automatic thoughts. Her initial homework assignment was to complete the first four columns of the Thought Record whenever she became upset. While the type of assignment is important, so is the amount of homework. Sally was a motivated patient who was \u201cin sync\u201d with home- work, as she was still a student. She was easily able to accomplish more between sessions than Matt, who was severely depressed and had been out of school for many years. A third step in tailoring homework to the individual patient involves breaking down assignments into manageable steps. Examples include reading one chapter of a layman\u2019s cognitive behavior therapy book or school textbook, doing the first four columns of a Thought Record, spending 10\u201315 minutes paying bills, doing just one load of laundry, and spending just five minutes at a supermarket. It is important to predict potential difficulties before assigning homework. Patients\u2019 diagnoses and personality styles can be a guide. Severely depressed patients, for example, initially will probably ben- efit more from behavioral (as opposed to cognitive) tasks. Avoidant patients shy away from behavioral assignments that they perceive as too challenging or likely to evoke a high level of dysphoria. Patients who are feeling anxious and overwhelmed might feel incapable of doing any assignment if you suggest too many tasks. ",

It is much better to err on the side of providing homework assignments that are a little too easy. Fail- ure to carry out an assignment, or to do it properly, often leads a patient to be self-critical or feel hopeless.  Homework 301 Providing a Rationale Patients are more likely to comply with homework assignments if they understand the reason for doing them. I introduce a homework assign- ment to Sally in this way: Therapist:\u2002 Sally, research shows that exercise often helps people become less depressed. What do you think about taking a walk or a run a few times this week? You will provide a brief rationale initially; later in treatment, you will encourage patients to think about the purpose of an assignment, for example, \u201cSally, what would be the point of checking with your roommate about her plans for this weekend?\u201d or \u201cWhy might it be a good idea to continue keeping the credit list?\u201d It is also important to emphasize that homework is an essential part of treatment: Therapist:\u2002 The way people get better is to make small changes in their thinking and behavior every day. Setting Homework Collaboratively Ideally, patients would set their own homework, but at the beginning of treatment they do not know which assignments would be beneficial. Instead, you will make suggestions and ensure they agree: \u201cWhat do you think about asking your boss for time off?\u201d; \u201cDo you think it could help if you read this coping card before you leave the house?\u201d; \u201cDo you want to try [a particular technique] this week?\u201d; \u201cI think if you get in the shower as soon as you get up, you\u2019ll demonstrate to yourself that you can take control. What do you think? Is this something you want to try?\u201d If patients are hesitant or skeptical, you will need to prepare them further. Either elicit and help them respond to their automatic thoughts and/or make the assignment much easier. As therapy progresses, you will encourage patients to set their own assignments. ",

Either elicit and help them respond to their automatic thoughts and/or make the assignment much easier.

Patients who do not do the homework are less likely to brand them- selves as failures and thus feel more dysphoric: 302 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 Sally, if you get this homework done, that\u2019s good. But if you have trouble doing it, that\u2019s okay\u2014just see if you can figure out what thoughts are getting in your way, and we\u2019ll talk about those thoughts next time. Okay? Sometimes patients fail to do a significant portion of their home- work for two weeks in a row, or they do it immediately before the ther- apy session instead of daily. In these cases, you should uncover the psychological and/or practical obstacles that got in the way and stress how essential homework is, instead of continuing to make it a no-lose proposition. Starting Homework in the Session If you can, have patients begin assignments right in the therapy session itself; they will be far more likely to follow through at home. Continuing an assignment is much easier than initiating one. This is especially criti- cal because patients often describe the hardest part of doing homework as the period just before they initiate it\u2014that is, motivating themselves to get started. If you yourself find that you, too, occasionally have difficulty initiating a task (e.g., getting yourself to work on a paper, pay taxes, or start exercising), but find it much easier after a few minutes, you can self-disclose this to patients to normalize the experience and provide a role model for them to think about when they are procrastinating. Remembering to Do Homework It is vital to write down, or have patients write down, their assignments every week, starting with the first session. Ask them where they will keep the assignment list (or notebook) and how likely they think they might be to forget to look at the list on one or more days. ",

Ask them where they will keep the assignment list (or notebook) and how likely they think they might be to forget to look at the list on one or more days. If even slightly likely, you might suggest several strategies: You can ask patients to: Pair an assignment with another daily activity (e.g., \u201cHow about \u2022 pulling out the activity chart at mealtimes and right before bed?\u201d). Post notes on their refrigerator, their bathroom mirror, or the \u2022 dashboard of their car. Use their appointment book, smartphone, or computer to cue \u2022 them. Ask another person to cue them. \u2022 You can also ask them how they remember to do other regularly sched- uled activities, such as taking medication.  Homework 303 Anticipating Problems To maximize the likelihood that you are suggesting reasonable assign- ments that patients are likely to do, consider the following: Is the amount and degree of difficulty of homework \u2022 reasonable for this patient, or will it feel overwhelming? Is it related to the patient\u2019s goals? \u2022 How likely is the patient to do it? \u2022 What practical problems may get in the way (time, \u2022 energy, opportunity)? What thoughts may get in the way? \u2022 The single most important question to ask patients to assess the probability of adherence is: How likely are you to do this, 0\u2013100%? If patients are less than 90\u2013100% confident, use one or more of the following strategies: 1.\t Covert rehearsal. 2.\t Change the assignment. 3.\t Do an intellectual/emotional role play. These stategies are described below. Covert Rehearsal Covert rehearsal, illustrated below, uses induced imagery to uncover and solve potential homework-related problems. Therapist:\u2002 Sally, do you think anything will get in the way of your going to the teaching assistant for help? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure. Therapist:\u2002 [getting her to specify and commit to a time] When would be a good time to go? Patient:\u2002 Friday morning, I guess. That\u2019s when his office hours are. 304 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 Can you imagine it\u2019s Friday morning right now? Can you picture it? Can you imagine saying to yourself, \u201cI really should go to the TA\u2019s office\u201d? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 [asking for details so Sally will more easily be able to visu- alize the scene and accurately identify her thoughts and emotions] Where are you? Patient:\u2002 In my room. Therapist:\u2002 Doing what? Patient:\u2002 Well, I just finished getting dressed. Therapist:\u2002 And how are you feeling? Patient:\u2002 A little nervous, I guess.

[Or, \u201cI\u2019m not sure this assignment is appropriate.\u201d] What do you think? Do you want to go ahead and try or wait until another time? You can also collaboratively decide to make certain assignments optional or to decrease the frequency or duration of a homework task. It is far better for patients to do less homework than no homework at all. Intellectual\u2013Emotional Role Play An intellectual\u2013emotional role play may help motivate reluctant patients when the therapist judges it is quite important for a patient to 306 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND do a given assignment. This technique is not used early in therapy, as it can be perceived as somewhat challenging. Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019m still not sure you\u2019ll actually pull out the coping card to get you going. Patient:\u2002 Probably not. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, how about if we do an intellectual\u2013emotional role play about this? \u00adWe\u2019ve done this before. I\u2019ll be the intellectual part of you; you be the emotional part. You argue as hard as you can against me so I can see all the arguments you\u2019re using not to read your coping cards and start studying. You start. Patient:\u2002 Okay. I \u00addon\u2019t feel like doing this. Therapist:\u2002 It\u2019s true that I \u00addon\u2019t feel like doing it, but that\u2019s irrelevant. It \u00addoesn\u2019t matter if I feel like it or not. It\u2019s what I need to do. Patient:\u2002 But I can do it later. Therapist:\u2002 True, but my usual pattern is not to do it later. I \u00addon\u2019t want to reinforce a bad habit by putting it off. Here I have the opportu- nity to strengthen a new, better habit. Patient:\u2002 But it \u00adwon\u2019t matter this one time. Therapist:\u2002 True. Any one individual time \u00adisn\u2019t all that crucial. On the other hand, I\u2019ll be better off in the long run if I strengthen this good habit as much as I can. Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know, I just \u00addon\u2019t want to. Therapist:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t have to pay attention to what I want to do now or \u00addon\u2019t want to do now. ",

Patient:\u2002 .\u2009.\u2009. \u00adI\u2019ve run out of arguments. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. Let\u2019s switch parts, then we\u2019ll get some of it down in writing. Following role reversal, you have another choice point. You can col- laboratively reassign the original homework task (e.g., \u201cHow do you feel now about trying [this assignment]?\u201d). If patients do decide to keep the assignment, you and they can jointly write a coping card with some points mentioned in the role play above. If you believe it is unlikely that the patient will fulfill the assignment, however, you should suggest a change in homework or make the assignment optional.  Homework 307 Preparing for a Possible Negative Outcome When devising a behavioral experiment or testing an assumption, it is important to set up a scenario that is likely to succeed. For example, Sally and I discussed which professor was most likely to be receptive to ques- tions after class, what words she might use when negotiating late-night noise with her roommate, and how much help was reasonable to ask from her friend. It is a good idea, though, to have patients predict likely auto- matic thoughts or beliefs if the experiment does not turn out well. Therapist:\u2002 Now I suppose it could happen that Ross says he \u00adcan\u2019t help you. If that happens, what will go through your mind? Patient:\u2002 That I \u00adshouldn\u2019t have asked. That he probably thinks I\u2019m stu- pid for asking. Therapist:\u2002 [seeking an alternative explanation] What other reasons might he have for saying no? Patient:\u2002 That he was too busy. Therapist:\u2002 Or is it possible that he \u00addoesn\u2019t understand the material well enough to explain it to you? Or, that he simply \u00addoesn\u2019t like tutoring? Or, that he\u2019s preoccupied with something else? Patient:\u2002 I guess so. Therapist:\u2002 Do you have any evidence so far that he thinks you\u2019re stu- pid? Patient:\u2002 No, but we did disagree about politics. Therapist:\u2002 And did you get the idea that he thought your ideas were definitely stupid or that you simply had another point of view? Patient:\u2002 That we just felt differently about it. ",

Therapist:\u2002 So even if he turns you down, it \u00adwon\u2019t necessarily be that he\u2019s changed his view of you, based on your request for help? Patient:\u2002 No, I guess not. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, \u00adwe\u2019ve agreed that you\u2019ll approach him later today and ask for help. Either he\u2019ll help you, and that\u2019s good, or he\u2019ll say no, and then what will you remind yourself? Patient:\u2002 That it \u00addoesn\u2019t mean he thinks I\u2019m stupid. He may just be busy or unsure of the stuff himself or not like to tutor people. Therapist:\u2002 Good, let\u2019s write that down, just in case. 308 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Advance discussion of potential problems guards against dysphoria when an experiment does not turn out well. Conceptualizing Difficulties When patients have difficulty doing their homework, conceptualize why the problem arose. Was it related to: A practical problem? \u2022 A psychological problem? \u2022 A psychological problem masked as a practical problem? \u2022 A problem related to the \u2022 therapist\u2019s cognitions? Practical Problems Most practical problems can be avoided if you carefully set the assign- ment and prepare the patient to do it. Covert rehearsal (described ear- lier) can also ferret out potential difficulties. Four common practical problems and their remedies are described next. Doing Therapy Homework at the Last Minute Ideally, patients carry on the work of the therapy session throughout the week. For example, it is most useful for patients to catch and record their automatic thoughts at the moment they notice their mood chang- ing and to respond to these thoughts either mentally or in writing. Some patients avoid thinking about therapy between sessions. Often, this avoidance is part of a larger problem, and you may first have to help patients identify and modify certain beliefs (e.g., \u201cIf I focus on a problem instead of distracting myself, I\u2019ll only feel worse\u201d or \u201cI \u00adcan\u2019t change, so why even try?\u201d). Other patients, however, need only a gentle reminder to look at their homework list daily. Forgetting the Rationale for an Assignment Occasionally, patients neglect an assignment because they do not remember why they were asked to do it. ",

Other patients, however, need only a gentle reminder to look at their homework list daily. Forgetting the Rationale for an Assignment Occasionally, patients neglect an assignment because they do not remember why they were asked to do it. This problem can be avoided by having patients (who have demonstrated this difficulty) record the rationale next to an assignment.  Homework 309 Patient:\u2002 I \u00addidn\u2019t do the relaxation exercises [or read the coping cards or practice controlled breathing or record my activities] because I was feeling fine this week. Therapist:\u2002 Do you remember what we said a few weeks ago\u2014why it\u2019s helpful to practice this every day, regardless of how you\u2019re feeling? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure. Therapist:\u2002 Well, let\u2019s say you \u00addon\u2019t practice your relaxation exercises for a couple of weeks. Then you have a very stressful week. How sharp will your skills be then? Patient:\u2002 Not very. Therapist:\u2002 Could we have you write down relaxation exercises for homework again this week with a reminder that you want to be really good at relaxation before you need to use it? (pause) Any other problems with practicing it? Disorganization or Lack of Accountability Many patients are more likely to do assignments when they have to mark off a daily checklist indicating whether they fulfilled an assign- ment. You or patients can draw a simple diagram (Figure 17.1) in ses- sion. Instruct patients to check off each assignment they complete each day. This technique both helps patients remember to do assignments and also makes them face what they are not doing. Alternately, patients can write down assignments on a daily calen- dar or appointment book. (Do the first day together in the office and ask patients to write down the rest in the reception room after the ses- sion.) Later, after completing assignments, patients can check or cross them off. A third technique, which you might use with patients whose adher- ence is likely to be low, is suggesting that they call your office to leave a message when they have completed an assignment. Knowing that you expect a message may motivate patients to do the homework.

Difficulty with an Assignment If you realize at a subsequent session that a homework assignment was too difficult or ill-defined (common problems with novice therapists), take responsibility. Otherwise patients may unfairly criticize themselves for not having successfully completed an assignment: Therapist:\u2002 Sally, now that \u00adwe\u2019ve talked about the problem you had with the homework, I can see that I \u00addidn\u2019t explain it well enough to you. [Or, \u201cI can see that it was really too hard.\u201d] I\u2019m sorry about that. What went through your mind when you \u00adcouldn\u2019t [or \u00addidn\u2019t] do it? Here you have an opportunity to (1) model that you can make and admit to mistakes, (2) build rapport, (3) demonstrate that you are con- cerned with tailoring therapy\u2014and homework assignments\u2014to the patient, and (4) help patients see an alternative explanation for their lack of success. Psychological Problems If patients \u00addon\u2019t do an assignment that was properly set up and which they had the opportunity to do, their difficulty may stem from one of the psychological factors described next. Negative Predictions When patients are in psychological distress, and particularly when they are depressed, they tend to assume negative outcomes. To identify dys- functional cognitions that interfered with doing a homework assign- ment, ask patients to recall a specific time they thought about doing the assignment and then elicit related cognitions and feelings: Therapist:\u2002 Was there a time this week when you did think about read- ing the booklet on depression? Patient:\u2002 Yes. I thought about it on and off. Therapist:\u2002 Tell me about one of these times. Did you think about it last night, for example? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. I was going to do it after dinner. Therapist:\u2002 What happened?  Homework 311 Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. I just \u00adcouldn\u2019t make myself do it. Therapist:\u2002 How were you feeling? Patient:\u2002 Down, sad, kind of tired. Therapist:\u2002 What was going through your mind as you thought about reading the booklet? Patient:\u2002 This is hard. I probably \u00adwon\u2019t be able to concentrate. I \u00adwon\u2019t understand it. Therapist:\u2002 Sounds like you were feeling pretty low. No wonder you were having trouble getting started. ",

No wonder you were having trouble getting started. In fact, maybe we should have had you start reading it right in our session last week. (pause) I wonder how we could test this idea that you \u00adwon\u2019t be able to con- centrate and understand it. Patient:\u2002 I guess I could try it. You might then ask patients to conduct an experiment right in session. Following a successful outcome, they might write down conclusions such as: \u201cSometimes my thoughts \u00adaren\u2019t true and I can do more than I think. Next time I feel hopeless, I can do an experiment, like I did with the booklet.\u201d (Note: If the experiment were unsuccessful, you would need to change the assignment to a more basic task.) Patients can test other negative predictions (such as, \u201cMy room- mate \u00adwon\u2019t want to go to that meeting with me,\u201d or \u201cI \u00adwon\u2019t understand the material even if I ask for help,\u201d or \u201cDoing homework will make me feel worse\u201d) through behavioral experiments. Again, it is important to prepare patients for their reaction to a possible negative outcome. You can help patients evaluate other thoughts, such as, \u201cI \u00adcan\u2019t do anything right,\u201d or \u201cI might fail this course,\u201d with standard Socratic question- ing. When patients reveal ambivalence about the usefulness of doing an assignment, you should acknowledge that you do not know what the outcome will be: \u201cI \u00addon\u2019t know for sure that doing this assignment will help. What will you lose if it \u00addoesn\u2019t work? What\u2019s the potential gain in the long run if it does work?\u201d Alternatively, you and the patient could list advantages and disadvantages of doing the homework. Finally, a patient may benefit from work at the belief level. Home- work may activate beliefs such as: \u201cI\u2019m incompetent.\u201d \u201cHaving to do therapy homework means I\u2019m defective.\u201d \u201cI \u00adshouldn\u2019t have to put forth so much effort to feel better.\u201d \u201cMy therapist is trying to control me.\u201d 312 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND \u201cIf I think about my problems, I\u2019ll feel worse and worse.\u201d \u201cIf I do homework and get better, my life will get worse.\u201d These kinds of beliefs can be identified and modified through techniques described in Chapters 13 and 14. Overestimating the Demands of an Assignment Some patients overestimate how inconvenient or difficult it will be to do homework or do not realize that doing a therapy assignment will be time limited.

Overestimating the Demands of an Assignment Some patients overestimate how inconvenient or difficult it will be to do homework or do not realize that doing a therapy assignment will be time limited. Therapist:\u2002 What could get in the way of your doing a Thought Record a few times this week? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll find the time. Therapist:\u2002 How long do you think it will take each time? Patient:\u2002 Not that long. Maybe 10 minutes. But I\u2019m pretty rushed these days, you know. I do have a million things to do. You can then do straightforward problem solving to find possible time slots. Alternatively, you might propose an analogy, stressing that the inconvenience of doing assignments is time limited: Therapist:\u2002 It certainly is true; you are very busy these days. I wonder\u2014 this is an extreme example, I know\u2014but what would you do if you had to take time every day to do something that would save your life [or your loved one\u2019s life]? What would happen, for example, if you needed a blood transfusion every day? Patient:\u2002 Well, of course I\u2019d find the time. Therapist:\u2002 Now, it\u2019s obviously not life threatening if you \u00addon\u2019t do this assignment, but the principle is the same. In a minute, we can talk specifically about how you could cut back in another area, but first it\u2019s important to remember that this is not for the rest of your life. We just need you to rearrange some things for a little while until you\u2019re feeling better. The patient who overestimates the energy an assignment benefits from similar questions. In the next example, the patient has a dysfunc- tional (and distorted) image of fulfilling an assignment. Therapist:\u2002 What could get in the way of your going to the mall every day this week? Patient:\u2002 (Sighs.) I \u00addon\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have the energy.  Homework 313 Therapist:\u2002 What are you envisioning? Patient:\u2002 Well, I can see dragging myself into one store after another. Therapist:\u2002 You know, we talked about your going just for 10 minutes every day. How many stores would you actually get to in 10 minutes? I wonder if you could be imagining that this assignment will be more difficult than we had planned? In a different situation, the patient has correctly recalled the assign- ment but again overestimates the energy it will require. I first help specify the problem by doing a modified, short version of covert rehearsal. ",

Therapist:\u2002 Will the problem be mostly getting out of the house, going to the park, or what you\u2019ll have to do at the park? Patient:\u2002 Getting out of the house. I have to get so much stuff together\u2014 his diaper bag, the stroller, a bottle, his coat and boots\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. [The therapist and patient then problem-solve; one solution is for her to gather all the necessities earlier in the day when she is feeling more energetic and less overwhelmed.] In a third situation, I simply set up the assignment as an experi- ment. Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll have the energy to make the phone calls. Therapist:\u2002 Since \u00adwe\u2019ve run short of time today, how about if we just set up this assignment as an experiment: Let\u2019s write down your predic- tion\u2014\u201cI \u00adwon\u2019t have enough energy to make the calls\u201d\u2014and next session, you can tell me how accurate it was. Is that okay? Perfectionism Many patients benefit from a simple reminder that they should not strive for perfection when doing homework: Therapist:\u2002 Learning to identify your automatic thoughts is a skill, like learning the computer. You\u2019ll get better with practice. So, if you have any trouble this week, \u00addon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll figure out how to do it better at our next session. Other patients with a strong underlying assumption about the necessity of being perfect may benefit from assignments that include mistakes: 314 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 It sounds as if your belief about perfectionism is showing up in difficulty doing therapy homework. Patient:\u2002 Yeah, it is. Therapist:\u2002 How about this week if we have you do a Thought Record that is deliberately imperfect? You could do it with messy handwrit- ing or not do it thoroughly or make spelling mistakes. We should also put a 10-minute time limit on it. Psychological Obstacles Masked as Practical Problems Some patients propose that practical problems such as lack of time, energy, or opportunity may prevent them from carrying out an assign- ment. If you believe that a thought or belief is also interfering, you should investigate this possibility before discussing the practical problem: Therapist:\u2002 Okay, so you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll be able to do this assign- ment [because of a practical problem].

Let\u2019s pretend for a moment that this problem magically disappears. Now how likely are you do to the homework? Would anything else interfere? Any thoughts that would get in the way? Problems Related to the Therapist\u2019s Cognitions Finally, you should assess whether any of your thoughts or beliefs hin- der you from assertively and appropriately encouraging a patient to do homework. Typical dysfunctional assumptions of therapists include: \u201cI\u2019ll hurt his feelings if I try to find out why he \u00addidn\u2019t do the\u00a0homework.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll get angry if I [nicely] question her.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll be insulted if I suggest he try a homework monitor.\u201d \u201cShe \u00addoesn\u2019t really need to do homework to get better.\u201d \u201cHe is too overburdened now with other things.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s too passive\u2013aggressive to do homework.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s too fragile to expose himself to an anxious situation.\u201d Ask yourself what goes through your mind when you think about assigning homework or exploring why a patient has not done home- work. If you are having dysfunctional thoughts, you might do Thought Records or behavioral experiments or consult a supervisor or peer. Remind yourself that you are not doing patients a favor if you allow  Homework 315 them to skip homework (which research shows is important) and do not make extensive efforts to gain adherence. Reviewing Homework Before each session, you should prepare by reviewing the notes of the previous session and noting the patient\u2019s homework. A discussion of homework is typically the first item on the agenda, unless it is clearly inappropriate (e.g., the patient is grieving a recent, serious loss). Even if a patient is in crisis, it is still useful to spend a few minutes discuss- ing homework later in the session or, in a different case, to collabora- tively agree that the homework assigned at the previous session does not apply at the moment. Deciding how much time to spend reviewing homework and dis- cussing whether patients want to continue any assignment is part of the art of therapy. You will spend more time on homework when: It covers an important, ongoing problem that requires further \u2022 discussion. Patients have not completed a task. \u2022 You judge that it is important to discuss what patients have learned \u2022 or to help them reach a new understanding of their problems. ",

Patients have not completed a task. \u2022 You judge that it is important to discuss what patients have learned \u2022 or to help them reach a new understanding of their problems. For example, if severely depressed patients do not follow through with activity scheduling, you will likely spend significant time in session con- ceptualizing what happened and planning with them how they can be more successful in the coming week. Spending too little time reviewing homework may deprive patients of reinforcing important learning and skills. Spending too much time may deprive patients of discussing new problems thoroughly. The time you devote to a review of homework will vary. At the beginning of treatment, you will reinforce what was in the therapy notes (e.g., asking patients how much they believe the adaptive responses they wrote in the past session(s) and at home). You may need to review and allow patients to practice skills they did not quite grasp. You will also collaboratively decide which assignments a patient will continue or modify for the coming week. In summary, both you and your patients should view homework as an essential part of treatment. Homework, properly assigned and com- pleted, speeds progress and allows patients to practice the techniques of therapy which they will need when therapy is over. Kazantzis, Deane, Ronan, and Lampropoulos (2005) and Tompkins (2004) are helpful resources.  316 Chapter 18 TERmINATION AND RElAPSE PREVENTION T he goal in cognitive behavior therapy is to facilitate remission of patients\u2019 disorders and to teach them skills they can use throughout their lifetime. The goal is not for you to solve all their problems. In fact, if you view yourself as responsible for helping patients with every prob- lem, you risk engendering or reinforcing dependence and you deprive patients of the opportunity to test and strengthen their skills. Therapy sessions are usually scheduled once a week, unless there are practical constraints. Patients with severe symptoms may benefi t from more frequent sessions. Once patients have experienced a reduc- tion in symptoms and have learned basic skills, you may collaboratively agree to taper therapy gradually, on a trial basis, to once every 2 weeks and then to once every 3 to 4 weeks. In addition, patients are encour- aged to schedule \u201cbooster\u201d sessions approximately 3, 6, and 12 months after termination. This chapter outlines steps to prepare patients for termination and possible relapse from the start of therapy to the fi nal booster session. ",

EARlY ACTIVITIES You will begin to prepare patients for termination and relapse even in the initial session, as you tell them that your goal is to make treatment as time limited as possible, with the aim of helping them become their own therapist. As soon as they start to feel better, it is important to  Termination and Relapse Prevention 317 have a discussion about the course of recovery. Patients benefit from a visual depiction (Figure 18.1) of the course of progress, with periods of improvement that are typically interrupted (temporarily) by plateaus, fluctuations, or setbacks. (Later you will stress that life after therapy may be marked by occasional setbacks or difficulties but that patients will be better equipped to handle them on their own.) Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling a little better. But I should tell you that you may still have ups and downs. Most people go along feel- ing a little better and a little better, then at some point, they reach a plateau or have a setback. Then they feel a little better and a little better, and then there may be another plateau or setback. So it\u2019s normal to have ups and downs\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Can you see why it\u2019s important to remember that in the future? Patient:\u2002 I guess so I \u00adwon\u2019t worry so much about the down parts. Therapist:\u2002 Exactly. You can remember this discussion where we pre- dicted some low points. In fact, you might want to refer to a graph [Figure 18.1]. This is a rough idea of what might happen. Do you see that the setbacks usually get fewer and shorter and generally less severe as time goes on? Patient:\u2002 Uh-huh. Therapist:\u2002 It\u2019s important for you to remember this graph, because otherwise, when you have a setback, you might think that therapy \u00addoesn\u2019t work, that you\u2019ll never get better. FIGURE 18.1.\u2002 Progress in therapy. This graph, if skillfully drawn, can be made to resemble the southern border of the United States, with setbacks represented by \u201cTexas\u201d and \u201cFlorida.\u201d While striking some patients and therapists as humorous, this illustration may help patients recall that setbacks are normal. Improvement Time 318 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 You will probably have mild ups and downs even after therapy, because everyone does. Of course, by then, you\u2019ll have the tools you need to help yourself. ",

Activities Throughout Therapy Certain techniques should be used throughout treatment to facilitate relapse prevention. Attributing Progress to the Patient You should be alert at every session for opportunities to reinforce patients for their progress. When they experience an improvement in mood, find out why they think they are feeling better and reinforce the idea, whenever possible, that they have brought about changes in their mood by making changes in their thinking and behavior. Therapist:\u2002 It sounds as if your level of depression is lower this week. Why do you think that happened? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure. Therapist:\u2002 Did you do anything differently this week? Did you go ahead and do the activities we scheduled? Or did you respond to your negative thoughts? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. I actually exercised every day, and I went out with friends twice. A few times I really criticized myself but I read my coping cards. Therapist:\u2002 Is it possible you\u2019re feeling better this week because you did a number of things that helped? Patient:\u2002 Yes, I think so. Therapist:\u2002 So what can you say about how you made progress? Patient:\u2002 I guess when I do things to help myself, I do feel better. Some patients initially believe that all the credit for feeling better goes to their therapist. An alternative attribution\u2014that the patient is responsible for positive changes\u2014can fortify the patient\u2019s sense of self- efficacy.  Termination and Relapse Prevention 319 Therapist:\u2002 Why do you think you\u2019re feeling better this week? Patient:\u2002 You really helped me last session. Therapist:\u2002 Well, I may have taught you some things, but who was it who actually changed your thinking and your behavior this week? Patient:\u2002 I guess I did. Therapist:\u2002 How much do you believe, then, that it\u2019s really you who deserves the credit? Alternatively, patients may attribute all the improvement to a change in circumstance (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m feeling better because my boyfriend called me\u201d) or to medication. While you should acknowledge such external factors, you should also ask about changes in their thinking or behavior that could have contributed to or helped maintain their improvement. ",

When patients persist in believing that they do not deserve credit, you might decide to elicit their underlying belief (\u201cWhat does it mean to you that I\u2019m trying to give you credit?\u201d). Teaching and Using Tools/Techniques Learned in Therapy When teaching patients techniques and tools, you will stress that these are lifelong aids the patient can use in a number of situations now and in the future\u2014that is, these techniques are not specific to just one dis- order such as depression, but they can be used whenever patients real- ize they are reacting in an overly emotional or dysfunctional way. Com- mon techniques and tools that can be used during and after therapy include the following: 1.\t Breaking down big problems into manageable components. 2.\t Brainstorming solutions to problems. 3.\t Identifying, testing, and responding to automatic thoughts and beliefs. 4.\t Using Thought Records. 5.\t Monitoring and scheduling activities. 6.\t Doing relaxation exercises. 7.\t Using distraction and refocusing techniques. 8.\t Creating hierarchies of avoided tasks or situations. 9.\t Writing credit lists. 10.\t Identifying advantages and disadvantages (of specific thoughts, beliefs, behaviors, or choices when making a decision). 320 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND You should help patients understand how they can use these tools in other situations during and after therapy: Therapist:\u2002 So identifying your depressing thoughts and then ques- tioning and responding to them really reduced how sad you felt? Patient:\u2002 Yes, it did. I was surprised. Therapist:\u2002 Did you know you could use these same tools whenever you feel you\u2019re overreacting\u2014when you think you feel more anger, anxiety, sadness, embarrassment, and so forth\u2014than the situation calls for? Patient:\u2002 I \u00adhadn\u2019t really thought about it. Therapist:\u2002 Now, I\u2019m not saying you should try to get rid of all nega- tive emotion\u2014only when you think you might be overreacting. Can you think of any other situations that came up in the last few weeks where it might have helped to use a Thought Record? Patient:\u2002 (Pauses.) Nothing really comes to mind. Therapist:\u2002 Any situations coming up in the next few weeks where it might be helpful to use a Thought Record? Patient:\u2002 (Pauses.) Well, I know I\u2019m going to be really angry at my brother if he decides to stay at school for the summer instead of coming home. ",

Therapist:\u2002 What do you think of doing a Thought Record on this situ- ation, writing down and then responding to your thoughts? Patient:\u2002 Okay. Preparing for Setbacks during Therapy As soon as patients begin to feel better, you will prepare them for a potential setback by asking them to imagine what will go through their mind if they start to feel worse. Common responses include: \u201cI \u00adshouldn\u2019t be feeling this way\u201d; \u201cThis means I\u2019m not getting better\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m hopeless\u201d; \u201cI\u2019ll never get well\u201d; \u201cMy therapist will be disappointed\u201d; or \u201cMy thera- pist \u00adisn\u2019t doing a good job\u201d; \u201cCognitive behavior therapy \u00addoesn\u2019t work for me\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m doomed to be depressed forever\u201d; \u201cIt was only a fluke that I felt better initially\u201d; or patients may report an image of themselves in the future, for example, feeling frightened, alone, sad, huddled in the corner of their bed. Coping cards and the Progress in Therapy graph (Figure 18.1) can help avoid these negative cognitions.  Termination and Relapse Prevention 321 Therapist:\u2002 Well, \u00adyou\u2019ve really been making nice progress. Your depres- sion seems to be lifting quite a bit. Patient:\u2002 I am feeling better. Therapist:\u2002 Do you remember that we talked about setbacks a couple of weeks ago? Patient:\u2002 A little. Therapist:\u2002 Since it\u2019s possible you could have a setback, I\u2019d like to dis- cuss in advance how you could handle it. Patient:\u2002 Okay. Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019d like you to imagine for a moment that \u00adyou\u2019ve had a bad week. Nothing seems to have gone well. Everything looks black again. You\u2019re really down on yourself. It seems hopeless. Can you get a picture of that in your mind? Patient:\u2002 Yes. It\u2019s like it was before therapy. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. Tell me what\u2019s going through your mind now. Patient:\u2002 (Pauses.) It\u2019s not fair. I was doing so well. This \u00adisn\u2019t work- ing. Therapist:\u2002 Good. Now, how can you answer these thoughts? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019m not sure. Therapist:\u2002 Well, you have a choice. You can continue to think these depressing thoughts. If you do, what do you predict will happen to your mood? Patient:\u2002 I\u2019ll probably feel worse. Therapist:\u2002 Or  you can remind yourself that this is only a setback, which is normal and temporary. Then how would you feel? Patient:\u2002 Better, probably, or at least not worse.

Therapist:\u2002 Is there a reason to expect that the tools which helped you before \u00adwon\u2019t help you again? 322 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Patient:\u2002 No. Therapist:\u2002 So you can respond to your negative thoughts and start concentrating on something else. Do you think it\u2019s worth writing down what we just talked about\u2014so you\u2019ll have a plan in case you do have a setback at some point? Near Termination Activities Responding to Concerns about Tapering Sessions Several weeks before termination, you should discuss tapering ses- sions, as an experiment, from once a week to once every other week. Although some patients readily agree to this arrangement, others may become anxious. It is useful for this latter group of patients to list ver- bally and perhaps record in writing the advantages of trying to reduce the frequency of visits. When patients fail to see advantages, you should first elicit disadvantages, use guided discovery to help patients identify advantages, and then help them reframe the disadvantages (see Figure 18.2). Advantages of tapering therapy 1.\t I\u2019ll have more opportunity to use and sharpen my tools. 2.\t I\u2019ll be less dependent on [my therapist]. 3.\t I can use the therapy fee for other things. 4.\t I can spend more time [doing other things]. Disadvantages Reframe 1.\t I might relapse. If I\u2019m going to relapse, it\u2019s better for it to happen while I\u2019m still in therapy so I can learn how to handle it. 2.\t I may not be able to solve problems myself. Tapering therapy gives me the chance to test my idea that I need [my therapist]. In the long run, it\u2019s better for me to learn to solve problems myself, because I \u00adwon\u2019t be in therapy forever. 3.\t I\u2019ll miss [my therapist]. This is probably true, but I\u2019ll be able to tolerate it and it will encourage me to build up a support network. FIGURE 18.2.\u2002 Advantages and disadvantages (to Sally) of tapering therapy.  ",

Termination and Relapse Prevention 323 The following transcript illustrates how such a discussion might proceed: Therapist:\u2002 In our last session, we briefly discussed the possibility of experimenting with spacing our therapy sessions. Did you think about going to an every-other-week schedule on a trial basis? Patient:\u2002 I did. It made me a little anxious. Therapist:\u2002 What went through your mind? Patient:\u2002 Oh, what if something happens that I \u00adcan\u2019t deal with? What if I start getting more depressed\u2014I \u00adcouldn\u2019t stand that. Therapist:\u2002 Did you evaluate these thoughts? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. I realized I was catastrophizing, that it \u00adwasn\u2019t the abso- lute end of therapy. And you did say I could call you if I needed to. Therapist:\u2002 That\u2019s right. Did you imagine a specific situation that might come up that would be difficult? Patient:\u2002 No, not really. Therapist:\u2002 Maybe it would help if we had you imagine a specific prob- lem now. Patient:\u2002 Okay. [Sally imagines getting a low grade on a test, identifies her automatic thoughts, responds to the thoughts, and makes a specific plan for what to do next.] Therapist:\u2002 Now, let\u2019s talk about the second automatic thought you had about spacing our sessions\u2014that you\u2019d get more depressed and that you \u00adwouldn\u2019t be able to stand it. Patient:\u2002 I guess that may not be quite true. \u00adYou\u2019ve made me realize that I could stand to feel bad again. But I \u00adwouldn\u2019t like it. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. Now let\u2019s say you do get more depressed and it\u2019s still a week and a half before our next session. What can you do? Patient:\u2002 Well, I can do what I did about a month ago. Reread my therapy notes, make sure I stay active, do more Thought Records. Somewhere in my notes I have a list of things to do. Therapist:\u2002 Would it be helpful to find that list now? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. How about for homework if you find the list and write a Thought Record for these two thoughts: \u201cSomething might happen that I \u00adcouldn\u2019t deal with,\u201d and \u201cI \u00adcouldn\u2019t stand it if I got more depressed.\u201d Patient:\u2002 Okay. 324 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Therapist:\u2002 Any other thoughts about spacing our sessions? Patient:\u2002 Just that I\u2019d miss not having you to talk to every week. Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019ll miss that, too. Is there anyone else you could talk to, even a little? ",

Therapist:\u2002 And finally, do you remember that we said we could experi- ment with every-other-week sessions? If it\u2019s not working well, I do want you to call me so you can come in sooner. Responding to Concerns about Termination When patients are doing well with biweekly sessions, you might suggest scheduling the next appointment for 3 or 4 weeks in the future, in prep- aration for termination. Again, tapering can be viewed as an experi- ment. At each succeeding session, you and the patient agree either to continue spacing sessions or to return to more frequent sessions. As termination approaches, it is important to elicit patients\u2019 auto- matic thoughts about termination. Some patients are excited and hope- ful. At the other extreme, some patients are fearful or even angry. Most have some mixed feelings. They are pleased with their progress but concerned about relapse. Often they are sorry to end their relationship with you. It is important both to acknowledge what patients are feeling and help them respond to any distortions. It is often desirable for you to express your own genuine feelings, if you can honestly say that you regret the (gradual) ending of the relationship but feel pride in what they have achieved in therapy and that you believe they are ready to make it on their own. Responding to other automatic thoughts and examining advantages and disadvantages of termination can be carried out in the same way as was previously described in responding to thoughts about tapering sessions. Additional strategies to help patients who are con- cerned about termination can be found in Ludgate (2009). Reviewing What Was Learned in Therapy You will encourage patients to read through and organize their notes so they can easily refer to them in the future. For example, a good home-  Termination and Relapse Prevention 325 work assignment is to write a synopsis of the important points and skills they learned in treatment. Self-Therapy Sessions Although many patients do not follow through with formal self-therapy sessions, it is nevertheless useful to discuss a self-therapy plan (see Fig- ure 18.3) and to encourage its use.

Self-Therapy Sessions Although many patients do not follow through with formal self-therapy sessions, it is nevertheless useful to discuss a self-therapy plan (see Fig- ure 18.3) and to encourage its use. When patients try self-therapy ses- sions while regular therapy sessions are still being tapered, they are much more likely to do self-therapy after termination. And they can discover potential problems: not having enough time, misunderstand- ings about what to do, and interfering thoughts (e.g., \u201cThis is too much work\u201d; \u201cI \u00addon\u2019t really need to do it\u201d; \u201cI \u00adcan\u2019t do it on my own\u201d). In addi- tion to helping patients respond to these problems, you can remind patients of the advantages of self-therapy sessions: They are continuing therapy, but at their own convenience and without charge; they can keep their newly acquired tools fresh and ready to use; they can resolve difficulties before they become major problems; they reduce the pos- sibility of relapse; and they can use their skills to enrich their life in a variety of contexts. A generic self-therapy plan is presented in Figure 18.3. You can review it with patients and tailor it to meet their needs. Many patients benefit from a brief discussion of a reminder system: \u201cInitially, you might want to try a self-therapy session once a week, then taper it to once or twice a month, then to once a season, and eventually, to once a year. How could you remind yourself to pull out this self-therapy plan periodically?\u201d Preparing for Setbacks after Termination As mentioned previously, you begin preparing patients for setbacks early in treatment. As you near termination, you should encourage them to compose a coping card specifying what to do if a setback occurs after therapy has ended. (See Figure 18.4 for a typical card.) It is desirable for patients to attempt to resolve their difficulties on their own before calling you. If they do need another appointment, you can help them discover what got in the way of their handling the setback or problem independently, and together you can plan what the patient can do differently in the future.  326 Reprinted by permission in Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Basics and Beyond, Second Edition, by Judith S.

Termination and Relapse Prevention 327 Booster Sessions You should encourage patients to schedule booster sessions after ter- mination for several reasons. If any difficulties have arisen, you can discuss how patients handled them and assess whether they could have handled them in a better way. Together you can look ahead to the next several weeks and months and predict future difficulties that could arise. Then you can jointly formulate a plan to deal with these situa- tions. Knowing that you will ask them about their progress doing self- therapy may motivate patients to do their cognitive behavior therapy homework and practice their skills. In addition, you can help patients determine whether their previously modified dysfunctional beliefs have been reactivated. If so, they can do cognitive restructuring in session and plan for continued belief work at home. Booster sessions also afford you the opportunity to check on the reemergence of dysfunctional strategies (such as avoidance). Patients can express any new or previously unaccomplished goals and develop a plan to work toward them. Together you can evaluate their self-therapy program and modify as needed. ",

Finally, when patients know they are scheduled for booster sessions after termination, their anxiety about maintaining progress on their own is usually alleviated. What I can do in case of a setback: 1.\t I have a choice. I can catastrophize about the setback, get myself  all upset, think things are hopeless, and probably feel worse. Or I  can look back over my therapy notes, remember that setbacks  are a normal part of recovery, and see what I can learn from this  setback. Doing these things will probably make me feel better and  make the setback less severe. 2.\t Next, I should have a self-therapy session and plan what to do  to solve my problems. 3.\t I should call [a specific friend or family member] if I need more help. 4.\t I can call [my therapist] to briefly discuss what to do or to  schedule another session. FIGURE 18.4.\u2002 Sally\u2019s coping card about setbacks. 328 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND To prepare for booster sessions, you may provide patients with a list of questions (see Figure 18.5). As the following transcript indicates, the overall goal for the booster session is to check on the patient\u2019s well-being and plan for continued maintenance or progress. Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019m glad you were able to come in today. It looks like, from the Beck Depression Inventory, that you\u2019re a little more depressed than the last time we met. Is that right? Patient:\u2002 Yes, my girlfriend recently broke up with me. Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Do you think that situation accounted for the rise in your score? Patient:\u2002 I think so. I was feeling pretty good until last week. Therapist:\u2002 Is the breakup something you\u2019d like to put on the agenda to talk about today? Patient:\u2002 Yes, that and my progress, or rather lack of progress, in look- ing for a new job. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. And I\u2019d like to find out how things have been going for you generally, aside from the breakup: whether you encoun- tered any other rough spots, how you dealt with them, how much cognitive behavior therapy homework you were able to do, any dif- ficulties you think may arise in the next 2 or 3 months. Does that sound okay? Patient:\u2002 Yes. Therapist:\u2002 Would you like to start with the breakup? Can you tell me how it came about? (We briefly discuss the breakup. ",

I am concerned with how the patient reacted to the breakup, whether his previous dysfunctional beliefs have become activated.) [summarizing] So things had begun to deteriorate, and she told you she wanted to start seeing other guys? When she told you that, what went through your mind? Patient:\u2002 That she \u00addidn\u2019t really love me. Therapist:\u2002 And what did that mean to you, that she \u00addidn\u2019t love you? Patient:\u2002 That there must be something wrong with me. Therapist:\u2002 And what did you think was wrong with you? Patient:\u2002 That I\u2019m not very lovable. Therapist:\u2002 How much did you believe that you \u00adweren\u2019t very lovable right when she told you she wanted to see other men?

Therapist:\u2002 What made the difference? Patient:\u2002 Well, part of me knows that we probably just \u00adweren\u2019t right for each other. Therapist:\u2002 So you were able to modify this old idea of not being lov- able? Patient:\u2002 Somewhat. Therapist:\u2002 Right. Now what did you learn from therapy that you can do to damp down this unlovable idea further and strengthen the idea that you are lovable? Patient:\u2002 A Thought Record might help. And I know my therapy notes have a lot on it. I should have gone back and reread them. Therapist:\u2002 That might have helped. Did you think of doing that? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. I guess I thought it really \u00adwouldn\u2019t help. Therapist:\u2002 What do you think now? Patient:\u2002 Well, it helped me before, it should help me again. Therapist:\u2002 What would get in the way of going home and doing some work on it in the next couple of days? Patient:\u2002 Nothing. I\u2019ll do it. I think it probably will help. Therapist:\u2002 Now might this thought, \u201cIt \u00adwon\u2019t help,\u201d pop up again the next time you\u2019re going through a rough spot? Patient:\u2002 It might. Therapist:\u2002 What could you do now so it would be more likely that you\u2019d test that thought? Patient:\u2002 What could I do now? Therapist:\u2002 Yes. What could you do to remind yourself that you had the thought this time and then realized it might not be true? Patient:\u2002 I should write it down, maybe on a paper I keep in my desk. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, how about if you write down some of the things we just talked about\u2014doing a Thought Record on being unlovable, reading through your therapy notes, writing a response to the thought \u201cIt \u00adwon\u2019t help.\u201d In this portion of the booster session, I assess the patient\u2019s level of depression, set the agenda, discuss an issue, and help him set home- work for himself. I ascertain that he has only mild depressive symp- toms that seem primarily related to the breakup of the relationship. (Had the depression been more severe, I would have spent more time assessing triggers and identifying and modifying dysfunctional beliefs,  Termination and Relapse Prevention 331 thoughts, and behaviors. We would also have discussed the advisability of additional sessions.) This patient is easily able to express his automatic thoughts and underlying belief. ",

He and I spend little time developing a plan to help him modify his ideas; he had already learned the tools during therapy. He needed the booster session to remind and motivate himself to use the tools. In summary, relapse prevention is carried out throughout therapy. Problems in tapering sessions and in termination are addressed as any other problems, with a combination of problem solving and responding to dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs.  332 Chapter 19 TREATmENT PlANNING A t any given moment in therapy, how do you decide what to say or do next? Partial answers to this question have been provided through- out this book, but this chapter provides a more comprehensive frame- work for making decisions and planning treatment. To keep therapy focused and moving in the right direction, you continually ask yourself, \u201cWhat is the specifi c problem here, and what am I trying to accom- plish?\u201d You are cognizant of your objectives in the current portion of the session, in the session as a whole, in the current stage of therapy, and in treatment as a whole. This chapter outlines a number of areas essential to effective treatment planning: Accomplishing broad therapeutic goals. \u2022 Planning treatment across sessions. \u2022 Devising treatment plans. \u2022 Planning individual sessions. \u2022 Deciding whether to focus on a problem. \u2022 modifying standard treatment for specifi c disorders. \u2022  Treatment Planning 333 Accomplishing Broad Therapeutic Goals At the broadest level, your objectives are not only to facilitate a remis- sion of patients\u2019 disorders but also to prevent relapse. To do the latter, you tell patients early in treatment that one of your goals is to teach them to become their own therapist. To achieve your objectives, you will: 1.\t Build a sound therapeutic alliance with patients. 2.\t Make the structure and the process of therapy explicit. 3.\t Teach patients the cognitive model and share your conceptualization with them. 4.\t Help alleviate their distress through a variety of techniques and problem solving. 5.\t Teach them how to use these techniques themselves, help them generalize the use of the techniques, and motivate them to use the techniques in the future.

Planning Treatment across Sessions You develop a general plan for treatment and a specific plan for each individual session. Therapy can be viewed in three phases. In the beginning phase of treatment, you build a strong therapeutic alliance; identify and specify patients\u2019 goals for therapy; solve problems; teach patients the cognitive model; get patients behaviorally activated (if they are depressed and withdrawn); educate patients about their dis- order; teach them to identify, evaluate, and respond to their automatic thoughts; socialize them (to do homework, set an agenda in therapy, and provide feedback); and instruct patients in coping strategies. In this first phase of therapy, you often take the lead in suggesting home- work assignments. In the middle phase of therapy, you continue working toward these objectives but also emphasize identifying, evaluating, and modifying patients\u2019 beliefs. You share your conceptualization of patients with them and use both \u201cintellectual\u201d and \u201cemotional\u201d techniques to facilitate belief modification. You teach patients the skills they need to accom- plish their goals. In the final phase of therapy, the emphasis shifts to preparing for termination and preventing relapse. By this point, patients have become 334 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND much more active in therapy, taking the lead in setting the agenda, suggesting solutions to problems, taking therapy notes, and devising homework assignments. Creating a Treatment Plan You develop a treatment plan based on your evaluation of patients, their Axis I and Axis II symptoms and disorder(s), and their specific present- ing problems and goals. Sally, for example, set five goals in the first therapy session: to improve her schoolwork, decrease her anxiety about tests, spend more time with friends, join school activities, and have more fun. Based on her intake evaluation and these goals, I devised a general therapy plan (see Figure 19.1). In each session, we worked on several of the areas specified in the plan based on what we had covered in the previous session(s), what Sally had done for homework, and what problems or topics Sally put on the agenda that day. You also take each individual problem or goal and do a critical analysis, either mentally or on paper (Figure 19.2). Having formulated a general treatment plan, you adhere to it to a greater or lesser degree, revising it as necessary. ",

Doing so also helps you focus each session, grasp the flow of therapy from one session to the next, and become more cognizant of progress. 1.\u2002 Problem-solve how to improve her concentration, seek needed help in her courses, schedule time with friends, and join activities. 2.\u2002 Help her identify, evaluate, and respond to automatic thoughts about herself, school, other people, and therapy, especially those that are particularly distressing and/or hinder her from solving problems. 3.\u2002 Investigate dysfunctional beliefs about perfectionism and seeking help from others. 4.\u2002 Discuss her self-criticism and increase giving herself credit. 5.\u2002 Increase productive activity.

At the most general level, you ask yourself, \u201cWhat am I trying to accomplish, and how can I do so most efficiently?\u201d Experienced therapists automatically reflect on many specific issues. The following list of questions, while potentially daunting to the begin- ner, is a useful guide for more advanced therapists who wish to improve their ability to make better decisions about how to proceed within a therapy session. The list is designed to be read and considered before a therapy session as conscious contemplation of the questions during a session would undoubtedly interfere with the therapeutic process. 1.\t As you review your notes from the previous session before the session, you ask yourself: a.\t \u201cWhat is the patient\u2019s disorder(s)? How, if at all, does standard cognitive behavior therapy need to be varied for treatment of this disorder and this patient in particular?\u201d b.\t \u201cHow have I conceptualized the patient\u2019s difficulties? How, if at all, does standard cognitive behavior therapy need to be varied for this particular patient?\u201d c.\t \u201cAt which stage of therapy are we (beginning, middle, final)? How many sessions do we have left (if there is a limit)?\u201d d.\t \u201cWhat progress have we made so far in the patient\u2019s mood, behavior, symptoms? Toward the patient\u2019s goals and major prob- lems?\u201d e.\t \u201cHow strong is our therapeutic alliance? What, if anything, do I need to do today to strengthen it?\u201d f.\t \u201cAt which cognitive level have we primarily been working: auto- matic thoughts, intermediate beliefs, core beliefs, or a mixture? How much progress have we made at each level?\u201d 3.\t Use Socratic questioning to evaluate automatic thoughts. Teach use of Thought Record. 4.\t Use guided discovery to uncover meaning of automatic thoughts; put in conditional (If\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. then\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009.) format and test. 5.\t If applicable, use cognitive continuum to illustrate that achievement is on a continuum, rather than consisting of either perfection or failure.

Although you collaborate in making this decision with patients, you nevertheless guide therapy toward discussion of problems that are distressing and ongoing (or recurrent) and toward which you judge you will be able to make some progress during the session. You tend to limit discussion of problems that: Patients can solve themselves, \u2022 Are isolated incidents unlikely to recur, and/or \u2022 Are not particularly distressing. \u2022 Having identified and specified a problem, you do several things to help you decide how much time and effort to spend on the problem. You: 1.\t Gather more data about the problem. 2.\t Review your options. 3.\t Reflect on practical considerations. 4.\t Use the stage of therapy as a guide. 5.\t Change the focus when necessary. These five steps are described below. ",

These five steps are described below. Gathering More Data about a Problem When patients first bring up a problem or when the existence of a prob- lem becomes apparent in the midst of a session, you assess the nature of the problem to determine whether it seems worthwhile to intervene. For example, Sally has put a new problem on the agenda: Her father\u2019s business is failing, and Sally feels sad. I question her to assess how use- ful it will be to devote a significant portion of therapy time to this prob- lem. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, you said you wanted to bring up something about your dad and his business? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. His business has been pretty rocky for a while, but now it looks as if it may go bankrupt. Therapist:\u2002 [gathering more information] If it does go bankrupt, how will that affect you?  Treatment Planning 341 Patient:\u2002 Oh, nothing directly. I just feel so bad for him. I mean, he\u2019ll still have enough money but\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. he\u2019s worked really hard for this. Therapist:\u2002 [trying to discover whether there is a distortion in Sally\u2019s thinking] What do you think will happen if it does go bankrupt? Patient:\u2002 Well, he\u2019s already started looking for a new business. He\u2019s not the type to just lie around or take time off. Therapist:\u2002 [still assessing whether Sally is thinking dysfunctionally] What\u2019s the worst part of this to you? Patient:\u2002 Just that he probably feels bad. Therapist:\u2002 How do you feel when you think about his feeling badly? Patient:\u2002 Bad\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. sad. Therapist:\u2002 How sad? Patient:\u2002 A medium amount, I guess. Therapist:\u2002 [testing whether Sally can take a long view] Do you have a sense that though he may feel badly initially, he \u00adwon\u2019t stay that way indefinitely? That he\u2019ll probably get involved in another business and feel better? Patient:\u2002 Yeah, I think that\u2019ll probably happen. Therapist:\u2002 Do you think you\u2019re feeling \u201cnormal\u201d sadness over this? Or do you think this is affecting you too strongly? Patient:\u2002 I think I\u2019m having a normal reaction. Therapist:\u2002 [having assessed no further work on this problem is war- ranted] Anything else on this? Patient:\u2002 No, I \u00addon\u2019t think so. Therapist:\u2002 Okay. I\u2019m sorry this happened to your dad. ",

In another situation, you determine that a problem does require intervention. Therapist:\u2002 You wanted to talk about living arrangements for next year? Patient:\u2002 Yes. I\u2019m pretty upset. My roommate and I have decided to live together again. She wants to live off campus. So we have to look for an apartment in West Philly or Center City. But she\u2019s going home for spring vacation so it\u2019s mostly up to me to find a place. Therapist:\u2002 When were you feeling the most upset about this? 342 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND Patient:\u2002 Yesterday, when I agreed to start looking while she was away\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Actually, it was last night when I realized I \u00addidn\u2019t know what to do. Therapist:\u2002 How were you feeling? Patient:\u2002 Overwhelmed\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. anxious. Therapist:\u2002 As you were thinking about this last night, what was going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 What am I going to do? I \u00addon\u2019t even know where to start. Therapist:\u2002 [seeking a fuller picture; determining whether there were other important automatic thoughts] What else was going through your mind? Patient:\u2002 I was feeling overwhelmed. I \u00addidn\u2019t know what to do first, like should I go to a real estate agent? Should I look online? Therapist:\u2002 [probing for additional thoughts] Were you having any thoughts about your roommate? Patient:\u2002 No, not really. She said she\u2019d help when she got back. She said I \u00addidn\u2019t have to start looking until then. Therapist:\u2002 Were you making any predictions? Patient:\u2002 I \u00addon\u2019t know. Therapist:\u2002 [giving an opposite example] Well, were you thinking you\u2019d easily find a great place with a cheap rent? Patient:\u2002 No\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. no, I was thinking, \u201cWhat if I find a place and it turns out to be infested with cockroaches, or unsafe, or too noisy, or in really bad shape?\u201d Therapist:\u2002 Did you have an image like that in your mind? Patient:\u2002 Yeah. Dark, smelly, dirty. (Shudders.) Reviewing the Options Now that I have a fuller picture, I mentally review my options. I could do one or more of the following: 1.\t Engage Sally in straightforward problem solving, helping her decide which steps seem the most reasonable and feasible. 2.\t Teach Sally problem-solving skills, using this problem as an example. 3.\t ",

Treatment Planning 343 5.\t Have Sally identify the most distressing thought and help her evaluate it. 6.\t Teach Sally how to do a Thought Record using this situation. 7.\t Use the image she described as an opportunity to teach her imagery techniques. 8.\t Make a collaborative decision with Sally to move on to the next\u00a0agenda item (perhaps to an even more pressing problem) and\u00a0to\u00a0return to this problem later in the session or in a future session. Reflecting on Practical Considerations How do you decide which course to pursue? I took into account a num- ber of factors, including: 1.\t What is likely to bring Sally substantial relief? 2.\t What do we have time to do? What else do we need to do in the session? 3.\t What skills would be valuable to teach or review with Sally for which this problem provides an opportunity? 4.\t What, if anything, could Sally do herself (i.e., for homework) to relieve her distress? For example, if Sally could do a Thought Record on this at home, we can spend session time on other things that will speed her progress. Using the Stage of Therapy as a Guide You are often guided by a patient\u2019s stage of therapy. For example, you may avoid tackling a complex (but non-emergency) problem in the first few sessions with depressed patients if it is unlikely that you will make much headway toward solving it. Focusing on easier problem that are solvable, or partially solvable, engenders hope in patients and makes them more motivated to work in therapy. Changing the Focus in a Session Sometimes you \u00adcan\u2019t easily assess how difficult a problem will be or how likely it is that a particular discussion will activate a painful core belief. In these cases, you may initially focus on a problem but switch to another topic when you realize your interventions are not successful 344 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND and/or the patient is experiencing greater (unintended) distress. Fol- lowing is a transcript from an early therapy session. Therapist:\u2002 Okay, next on the agenda. You said you\u2019d like to meet more people. ",

Now, how could you meet new people this week? Patient:\u2002 (in a meek voice) I could talk to people at work. Therapist:\u2002 (noticing that the patient suddenly looks downcast) What\u2019s going through your mind right now? Patient:\u2002 It\u2019s hopeless. I\u2019ll never be able to do it. \u00adI\u2019ve tried this before. (Appears angry.) All my other therapists have tried this, too. But, I\u2019m telling you, I just \u00adcan\u2019t do it! It \u00adwon\u2019t work! I hypothesize from the patient\u2019s sudden negative affect shift that a core belief has been activated. I recognize that continuing in the same vein at this time will likely be counterproductive. Instead of refocusing on the problem, I decide to repair the therapeutic alliance by eliciting the patient\u2019s angry automatic thoughts (\u201cWhen I asked you how you could meet more people this week, what went through your mind?\u201d) and then helping her evaluate these thoughts. Later I gave the patient a choice about whether to return to this agenda item: Therapist:\u2002 I\u2019m glad you can see that I \u00adhadn\u2019t intended to make you do things you\u2019re not ready for. Now, would you like to return to the topic of meeting new people, or should we come back to it another time [at another session] and move on to the problem you had this week with your friend Elise? In summary, early in treatment you tend to guide discussion away from problems you are unlikely to be successful in solving or partially solving (if patients are agreeable to postponing discussion about them). At any point, you avoid focusing on problems that patients can resolve on their own, that they do not want to work on, or that are not particu- larly distressing to them. Modifying Standard Treatment for\u00a0Specific\u00a0Disorders It is essential that you have a solid understanding of patients\u2019 current symptoms and functioning, presenting problems, precipitating events, history, and diagnosis before starting therapy.

In summary, effective treatment planning requires a sound diagno- sis, a solid formulation of the case in cognitive terms, and consideration of the patient\u2019s characteristics and problems. Treatment is tailored to the individual; you develop an overall strategy as well as a specific plan for each session, considering the following: 1.\t Patients\u2019 diagnosis(es). 2.\t A conceptualization of their difficulties (which you check out with patients for accuracy). 3.\t Their goals for therapy. 4.\t Their most pressing concerns. 5.\t Your goals for therapy. 6.\t The stage of treatment. 7.\t Patients\u2019 learning characteristics, their stage of life, developmental and intellectual level, gender, and cultural background. 8.\t Patients\u2019 level of motivation. 9.\t The nature and strength of the therapeutic alliance. You develop and continually modify a general plan for treatment across sessions and a more specific plan before each session and within each session.  346 Chapter 20 PROBlEmS IN THERAPY P roblems of one kind or another arise with nearly every patient in cognitive behavior therapy. Even experienced therapists encoun- ter diffi culties at times in establishing a therapeutic alliance, correctly conceptualizing a patient\u2019s diffi culties, or consistently working toward joint objectives. A reasonable goal is not to avoid problems altogether but rather to learn to uncover and specify problems, to conceptualize how they arose, and to plan how to remediate them. It is useful to view problems or stuck points in therapy as opportuni- ties for you to refi ne your conceptualization of the patient. In addition, problems in therapy often provide insight into problems the patient experiences outside the offi ce. Finally, diffi culties with one patient pro- vide an opportunity for you to refi ne your own skills, to promote your fl exibility and creativity, and to gain new understandings and expertise in helping other patients, as problems can arise not just because of the patient\u2019s characteristics but also because of the therapist\u2019s relative weak- nesses. This chapter describes how to uncover the existence of prob- lems and how to conceptualize and remediate problems at stuck points in therapy. UNCOVERING THE ExISTENCE Of A PROBlEm You can uncover a problem in a number of ways:  Problems in Therapy 347 1.\t By listening to patients\u2019 unsolicited feedback. 2.\t By directly soliciting patients\u2019 feedback, whether or not they have provided verbal or nonverbal signals of a problem. 3.\t ",

A problem obviously exists when patients provide you with nega- tive feedback (e.g., \u201cI \u00addon\u2019t think you understand what I\u2019m saying,\u201d or \u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying intellectually but not in my gut\u201d). Many patients, however, allude indirectly to a problem (e.g., \u201cI see what you\u2019re saying, but I \u00addon\u2019t know if I could do it any other way,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019ll try\u201d [implying that they believe they will be unsuccessful in carrying out a task]). In these cases, you should question the patient further to ascer- tain whether a problem does indeed exist and to determine the dimen- sions of the problem. Many times, however, the patient fails to relate, either directly or indirectly, a problem with therapy. You can discover problems if you adhere to the standard structure of the session (which includes ask- ing the patient for feedback at the end of the session), by periodically checking on the depth of the patient\u2019s understanding during the ses- sion, and by eliciting the patient\u2019s automatic thoughts when you notice an affect shift during the session. For example, on one occasion I sensed through Sally\u2019s nonverbal cues (a faraway look in her eyes, restless shifting in her seat) that she was not fully processing what I was saying or that she did not agree. I asked her what was going through her mind. I took other steps through- out our session to make sure that Sally and I shared an understanding. I took care either to summarize often during the session or to ask Sally to summarize. I also asked her to rate how much she believed the sum- mary (e.g., \u201cSally, \u00adwe\u2019ve just been talking about the idea that you\u2019re not completely responsible for your mother\u2019s unhappiness even though you moved away from home\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. How much do you believe that now?\u201d). I further checked on Sally\u2019s understanding at different points dur- ing the session (e.g.",

How much do you believe that now?\u201d). I further checked on Sally\u2019s understanding at different points dur- ing the session (e.g., \u201cIs it clear to you why else your roommate might be reacting in this way?\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Could you put it in your own words?\u201d). I also made sure to elicit feedback at the end of the session (e.g., \u201cAnything I said today that bothered you?\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Anything you thought I \u00addidn\u2019t under- stand?\u201d). Because I guessed that Sally might hesitate to give me nega- 348 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND tive feedback, I also asked very specifically for feedback about a portion of the session during which I suspected she might have had a negative reaction: \u201cHow about when I suggested that you might be able to be more assertive with your mother? Did that bother you?\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009. Do you think you would be able to tell me if it had bothered you?\u201d In summary, you should seek to allay or to uncover problems within a therapy session by checking on patients\u2019 understanding, by asking for feedback, and by raising suspected problems directly during the session itself. You may also ask patients to complete a written evaluation of a session (page 77) that you can review with them at the next session. If you are a novice therapist, you may be unaware of the existence of a problem and/or be less able to specify a problem. You should solicit permission to record therapy sessions to review on your own or (pref- erably) with an experienced cognitive behavior therapist. Obtaining patients\u2019 consent is usually not a problem if you present it in a positive light: \u201cI have an unusual opportunity for you that I\u2019m only offering a few patients [or that I\u2019m only offering to you]. You should feel free to say yes or no. I occasionally record therapy sessions so I can listen to them later and figure out how I might be able to help patients more. [If relevant, \u201cI may play them to a colleague [or supervisor] to get feed- back. I always find that two heads are better than one.\u201d] I\u2019ll delete or erase the recording immediately afterward. (pause) Is it okay with you if we start out taping the session? ",

If it bothers you after a few minutes, we can always turn it off or get rid of the recording at the end.\u201d Another clear indication of a problem is a lack of progress or dete- rioration in a patient\u2019s functioning and/or mood (identified through self-report or objective tests such as the Beck Depression Inventory [see Appendix B]. You might suggest this lack of progress as an agenda item and collaborate with the patient in planning a more effective direction for treatment. Finally, you should continually try to put yourself in patients\u2019 shoes, to see how they view their world and to reveal what obstacles might inhibit\u00a0their ability to take a more functional perspective of their diffi- culties (e.g., \u201cIf I were Sally, how would I feel during therapy? What would I think when my therapist said \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003  or \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 ?\u201d). Conceptualizing Problems Having identified the existence of a problem, be alert for automatic thoughts blaming the patient (e.g., \u201cHe\u2019s resistant/manipulative/unmo- tivated\u201d). These labels tend to alleviate a therapist\u2019s sense of responsi- bility for resolving the difficulty and interfere with problem solving. Instead, ask yourself:  Problems in Therapy 349 \u201cWhat has the patient said (or not said) or done (or not done) in\u00a0session (or between sessions) that is a problem?\u201d Next, you ideally would consult with a supervisor who has reviewed a recording of the therapy session. You will undoubtedly need help in determining whether the problem is due to the patient\u2019s pathology, errors you have made, treatment factors (such as the level of care, for- mat of therapy, session frequency), and/or factors external to treatment (e.g., an organic disease, a psychologically toxic home or work environ- ment, ineffective medication or deleterious side effects, an absence of needed adjunctive treatments; see J. S. Beck, 2005). Having identified a problem that calls for a change in what you are doing, you will conceptualize the level at which the problem occurred: 1.\t Is it merely a technical problem? For example, did you use an inappropriate technique or use a technique incorrectly? 2.\t Is it a more complex problem with the session as a whole? For example, did you correctly identify a dysfunctional cognition but then fail to intervene effectively? 3.\t Is there an ongoing problem across several sessions? ",

Typically, problems occur in one or more of the following catego- ries: 1.\t Diagnosis, conceptualization, and treatment planning. 2.\t Therapeutic alliance. 3.\t Structure and/or pace of the session. 4.\t Socialization of the patient. 5.\t Dealing with automatic thoughts. 6.\t Accomplishing therapeutic goals in and across sessions. 7.\t Patients\u2019 processing of the session content. The following questions can help you and your supervisor specify the nature of a therapeutic problem.

Is he committed to working toward his goals? 3.\t Does the patient truly believe the cognitive model\u2014that his thinking influences his mood and behavior, that his thinking at times is dysfunctional, and that evaluating and responding to dysfunctional thinking positively affect how he feels emotionally and how he behaves? 4.\t Is the patient socialized to cognitive behavior therapy\u2014does he contribute to the agenda, collaboratively work toward solving problems, do homework, provide feedback? 5.\t Is the patient\u2019s biology (e.g., illness, medication side effects, or\u00a0inadequate level of medication) or his external environment 356 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND  (e.g., an abusive partner, an extremely demanding job, or an intolerable level of poverty or crime in his environment) interfering with your work together?

You should monitor your own thoughts and mood when seeking to conceptualize and remediate problems in therapy because your cogni- tions may at times interfere with problem solving. It is likely that all ther- apists, at least occasionally, have negative thoughts about patients, the therapy, and/or themselves as therapists.

Typical therapist assumptions that interfere with making changes to the therapy format include: \u201cIf I interrupt the patient, he\u2019ll think I\u2019m controlling him.\u201d \u201cIf I structure the session with an agenda, I\u2019ll miss something important.\u201d \u201cIf I record a session, I\u2019ll be too self-conscious.\u201d \u201cIf my patient gets annoyed with me, she\u2019ll drop out of therapy.\u201d Finally, when you encounter a problem in treatment, you have a choice. You can catastrophize about the problem and/or blame yourself or the patient. Alternatively, you can turn the problem into an oppor- tunity to refine your skills of conceptualization and treatment planning and to improve your technical expertise and your ability to vary therapy in accordance with the specific needs of each patient.  358 Chapter 21 PROGRESSING AS A COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPIST T his chapter briefl y outlines steps to initiate the practice of standard cognitive behavior therapy. You should gain experience with the basic techniques of cognitive behavior therapy by practicing them your- self before doing so with patients. (See Appendix B for information on obtaining patient worksheets, tests, and booklets.) Trying the tech- niques yourself allows you to correct diffi culties in application and put- ting yourself in the patient\u2019s role affords you the opportunity to identify obstacles (practical or psychological) that interfere with carrying out assignments. At a minimum, if you wish to become profi cient in cog- nitive behavior therapy, you should do the following (if you have not already done so): 1. Monitor your moods and identify your automatic thoughts when you experience dysphoria or anxiety, when you engage in maladaptive behavior, and/or avoid engaging in adaptive behavior. 2. Write down your automatic thoughts. If you skip this step, you deprive yourself of the opportunity to discover potential obstacles that your patients may have in writing down their thoughts: lack of opportu- nity, motivation, time, energy, and hope. When employing a technique such as assigning homework in session, you can then make a rapid com- parison between yourself and the patient. You think, \u201cWould I have diffi culty doing this assignment? What would I need to become moti- vated? What would get in the way of my doing it? Do I need to present  Progressing as a Cognitive Behavior Therapist 359 it in a more step-by-step fashion?\u201d In other words, your progress as a cognitive behavior therapist is facilitated if you bring an understanding of yourself and human nature in general to treatment. 3. Identify your automatic thoughts that interfere with carrying out the step above. Thoughts such as \u201cI \u00addon\u2019t have to write my automatic thoughts down,\u201d or \u201cI know this stuff. I can get by with doing this in my head,\u201d are likely to impede your progress. ",

I can get by with doing this in my head,\u201d are likely to impede your progress. A good adaptive response would acknowledge the partial truth of these thoughts but emphasize the advantages of behaving otherwise: \u201cIt\u2019s true that I can probably get by without using cognitive behavior therapy tools on myself. But it\u2019s also true that I will probably learn considerably more if I go ahead and write things down. I\u2019ll better understand why my patients have difficulty if I myself go through the same process first to see what it feels like and spot potential trouble spots. What\u2019s the big deal anyway? It\u2019ll only take a couple of minutes.\u201d 4. Once you have become proficient at identifying your automatic thoughts and emotions, start doing one Thought Record a day when you notice your mood changing. If your thoughts are not distorted, though, or if you tend automatically to respond adaptively to your thoughts in your head, doing a TR may not lead to a change in your affect. (Remem- ber that cognitive behavior therapists do not try to eliminate negative emotion; they try to reduce dysfunctional degrees of emotion.) However, whether or not you personally benefit from doing TRs, doing them will sharpen your skill in teaching your patients to do them. 5. Fill out the bottom half of the Cognitive Conceptualization Diagram using three typical situations in which you felt dysphoric or behaved in a maladaptive way. If you have difficulty specifying the situ- ation, identifying your thoughts or emotions, or uncovering the mean- ing of your thoughts, reread the relevant chapters in this book. 6. Continue to fill in the top half of the Cognitive Conceptualiza- tion Diagram. When you feel distressed, see whether there is a theme in the category of helplessness, unlovability, or worthlessness underneath. Once you have identified a core belief, fill in the other boxes. 7. Next, using a core belief identified in the prior exercises, fill out a Core Belief Worksheet (page 243). Examine your interpretation of situations to determine whether you are distorting evidence to sup- port a negative core belief and/or if you are ignoring or discounting evidence contrary to this core belief. Note: This exercise may not affect your belief system if you have positive, counterbalancing beliefs that are continuously activated, but completing the worksheet will at least make you more familiar with it and more likely to use it effectively with patients. 8.

Try other basic techniques: activity scheduling, credit lists, responding to spontaneous imagery, acting \u201cas if,\u201d writing and reading 360 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY: BASICS AND BEYOND coping cards, making functional self-comparisons, and writing down advantages and disadvantages when making a decision. 9. Having used some of the fundamental conceptual and treat- ment tools yourself, choose a straightforward, uncomplicated patient for your first attempt at cognitive behavior therapy. If you select a dif- ficult patient, the standard treatment as described in this book may be inappropriate. The ideal patient for a first cognitive behavior therapy experience is one who has a simple unipolar depression or adjustment disorder, with no diagnosis on Axis II. It is preferable to start with a new patient, rather than one whom you have been treating for a time using a different therapeutic orientation. It is also desirable to treat this patient according to the guidelines presented in this book, in as pure a fashion as possible. A note of caution: Therapists who are experienced in a dif- ferent modality are often tempted to fall back on previously acquired skills that hinder cognitive behavior therapy treatment. If it is more practical, however, you can start using cognitive behavior therapy tech- niques with a patient already in treatment with you. Be sure to explain what you would like to do, provide a rationale, and elicit the patient\u2019s agreement. 10. Obtain written consent for recording therapy sessions. Review of therapy tapes with a colleague or supervisor is essential to prog- ress. An indispensable tool for evaluating your tapes is the Cognitive Therapy Scale and Manual (see Appendix C). It is used extensively by cognitive behavior therapy supervisors to help trainees evaluate their work and plan for improvement and by researchers to rate therapist competency. 11. Continue throughout this process to read more about cogni- tive behavior therapy. Also be sure to read booklets, articles, or books that are intended for patients so you will be able to suggest appropriate bibliotherapy to them. 12. Refer to Wright, Basco, and Thase (2006) for additional guide- lines in becoming a competent cognitive behavior therapist. 13. Watch actual cognitive behavior therapy sessions conducted by master clinicians (see Appendix B). 14. Seek opportunities for training and supervision, either locally or through the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy (see Appendix B). 15. ",

Instructions for such a case write-up and scor- ing information are available at www.academyofct.org. I. CASE HISTORY A. Identifying Information: Sally is an 18-year-old Caucasian female college student, living in a freshman dorm with one roommate. B. Chief Complaint: Sally sought treatment for depression and anxiety. C. History of Present Illness: Several months after starting her fresh- man year of college, Sally developed symptoms of depression and anxiety. At intake, her symptoms included the following: Emotional symptoms \u2022 : sadness, anxiety, guilt, loss of pleasure and interest, hopelessness, loneliness. Cognitive symptoms \u2022 : pessimism, diffi culty concentrating and mak- ing decisions, mild catastrophizing, self-criticism. Behavioral symptoms \u2022 : social withdrawal, avoiding situations per- ceived as challenging (talking to professor, roommate, persist- ing in schoolwork). Physiological symptoms \u2022 : loss of energy, fatigue, lowered libido, cry- ing, restlessness, inability to relax, decreased appetite, disturbed sleep.  Sally faced the usual stressors of college freshmen: especially being away from home for the fi rst time and encountering academic chal- lenges. She fi t in well socially but after she became symptomatic, she began to isolate herself somewhat. 362 Appendix A D.\t Psychiatric History: Sally has no prior psychiatric history. E.\t Personal and Social History: Sally is the younger of two children in an intact family. Her brother is 5 years older than she and achieves more highly academically. Her mother was always highly critical of Sally. Her father was more supportive of Sally, but was away from home a great deal due to a demanding job. Her parents argued a considerable amount, but Sally \u00addoesn\u2019t believe that unduly affected her. Growing up, Sally feared harsh teachers and was anxious about her grades. She has long been critical of herself for not measuring up to her brother, although her relationship with him has been fine. ",

She has long been critical of herself for not measuring up to her brother, although her relationship with him has been fine. Sally has always had several close friends and dated throughout high school. She has maintained a good academic record. F.\t Medical History: Sally did not have any medical problems that influ- enced her psychological functioning or the treatment process. G.\tMental Status Check: Sally was fully oriented, with depressed mood. H.\tDSM-IV-TR Diagnoses: Axis I: Major Depressive Episode, Single Episode, Moderate \u2022 296.22 Axis II: None \u2022 Axis III: None \u2022 Axis IV: Severity of psychosocial stressors: mild (leaving home \u2022 for first time) Axis V: GAF Current\u201460. Best in Past Year\u201485. \u2022 II.\t CASE FORMULATION A.\t Precipitants: Sally\u2019s depressive disorder was precipitated by leav- ing home for college and experiencing some initial difficulty in her courses. Anxiety probably interfered with efficient studying; Sally then became quite self-critical and dysphoric. As she withdrew from activities and friends, the lack of positive input contributed to her low mood, as did her failure to solve academic difficulties. B.\t Cross-Sectional View of Current Cognitions and Behaviors: A typi- cal current problematic situation is that Sally has difficulty studying. While attempting to study, Sally has the automatic thoughts: \u201cI \u00adcan\u2019t do this; I\u2019m such a failure; I\u2019ll never make it here.\u201d She also has an image of herself, weighed down by a heavy backpack, trudging aim- lessly, looking downtrodden. These thoughts and image lead to feel- ings of sadness. In another situation, as she\u2019s studying for a test, she has the automatic thoughts: \u201cThis is too hard. What if the teaching assistant \u00adwon\u2019t help me? What if I flunk?\u201d and she feels anxious and then has difficulty concentrating. She also has the automatic thought: \u201cI should be doing more.\u201d She then feels guilty. In all of these situa- tions, she stops studying, lies on her bed, and sometimes cries.  Cognitive Case Write-Up 363 C.\t Longitudinal View of Cognitions and Behaviors: Sally always had a mild tendency to see herself as incompetent. While her school performance was above average, she was never among the brightest students in her classes. ",

Cognitive Case Write-Up 363 C.\t Longitudinal View of Cognitions and Behaviors: Sally always had a mild tendency to see herself as incompetent. While her school performance was above average, she was never among the brightest students in her classes. Academic success was very important to her and she developed certain assumptions: \u201cIf I work very hard then maybe I\u2019ll do okay but if I \u00addon\u2019t, I\u2019ll fail\u201d; \u201cIf I hide my weaknesses, I\u2019ll be okay [for the moment] but if I ask for help, I\u2019ll expose my incompetence.\u201d Her compensatory behavioral strategies included working excessively hard to live up to her potential and a tendency to avoid asking for help so she would not expose her weaknesses. Once she became depressed, she often used avoidance (of schoolwork, of confronting challenges, of social opportunities). For the most part, Sally\u2019s beliefs about other people were positive and functional; she tended to see others as well intentioned, although she was sometimes cowed by authority figures. She also believed that her world was rela- tively safe, stable, and predictable. D.\t Strengths and Assets: Sally had high psychological mindedness, objectivity, and adaptiveness. She was intelligent and before depres- sion set in, very hard working. She was motivated for therapy. She had the ability to form good, stable relationships with others. E.\t Working Hypothesis (Summary of Conceptualization): For much of her life, Sally saw herself as reasonably competent, worthwhile, and likeable. She was always vulnerable, however, to perceiving herself as incompetent, for at least three reasons: (1) her mother was highly critical of her growing up; (2) her supportive father was often not at home; and (3) she had a tendency to compare herself unfavorably to others. For example, Sally continually compared herself unfavorably to her brother, who (because he was 5 years older) could do almost everything better than she could. Instead of recognizing that she would likely be able to meet his accomplishments when she reached the same age, she interpreted the vast differences between what she was able to accomplish at a given time with what he accomplished during that same time as signs of her own incompetence. She also compared herself to the best students in the class and found herself lacking. Sally historically was vigilant for signs of incompetence in her- self and sometimes discounted or failed to recognize signs of compe- tence. She developed certain rules to ensure that her incompetence would not be exposed (e.g., \u201cI must work very hard\u201d; \u201cI must live up to my potential\u201d; \u201cI must always do my best\u201d).

As a result, she devel- oped the following compensatory strategies: she holds high expecta- tions for herself, works very hard, is vigilant for shortcomings, and avoids seeking help. Until she reached college, her life was guided by related assumptions: \u201cIf I achieve highly, it means I\u2019m okay.\u201d \u201cIf I hide my weaknesses, others will view me as competent.\u201d Throughout high school, Sally was able to achieve highly enough (in her estimation), but in her freshman year of college, she 364 Appendix A started to struggle with her studies. She became quite anxious. Her core belief of incompetence became activated. She started to have fearful automatic thoughts about failure. Her anxiety interfered with effective studying and problem solving. She also began to withdraw from others and avoid schoolwork and other challenges. Then the corollary to her underlying assumptions dominated her thinking: \u201cIf I \u00addon\u2019t achieve highly, it means I\u2019m incompetent.\u201d \u201cIf I ask for help, I\u2019ll be seen as incompetent.\u201d As she began to perform more poorly, she became convinced of her incompetence. Failing to be productive and failing to gain social support from others probably contributed to the onset of her depression. III.\t TREATMENT PLAN A.\t Problem List 1.\t Studying and writing papers 2.\t Volunteering in class and taking tests 3.\t Social withdrawal 4.\t Lack of assertiveness with roommate, professors 5.\t Spending too much time in bed B.\t Treatment Goals 1.\t Decrease self-criticism 2.\t Teach basic cognitive tools, Thought Record, etc. 3.\t Decrease time in bed 4.\t Find healthier ways to have fun. 5.\t Do problem solving around studying, papers, tests. 6.\t Build assertiveness skills C.\t Plan for Treatment: The treatment plan was to reduce Sally\u2019s depression and anxiety through helping her respond to her auto- matic thoughts (especially those connected with inadequacy and incompetence), increase her activities through activity scheduling, problem-solve difficulties with studying and homework, and build assertiveness through role-playing and modifying interfering beliefs. IV.\t COURSE OF TREATMENT A.\t Therapeutic Relationship: Sally easily engaged in treatment. She saw her therapist as competent and caring. B.\t Interventions/Procedures 1.\t Taught patient standard cognitive tools of examining and responding to her automatic thoughts (which allowed the patient  Cognitive Case Write-Up 365 to see her dysfunctional, distorted logic and thus significantly reduced depressive and anxious symptoms). 2.\t ",

GENERAL THERAPEUTIC SKILLS 1.\t AGENDA 0\t Therapist did not set agenda. 2\t Therapist set agenda that was vague or incomplete. 4\t Therapist worked with patient to set a mutually satisfactory agenda that included specific target problems (e.g., anxiety at work, dissatisfaction with marriage). 6\t Therapist worked with patient to set an appropriate agenda with target problems, suitable for the available time. Established priorities and then followed agenda. 2.\t FEEDBACK 0\t Therapist did not ask for feedback to determine patient\u2019s understanding of, or response to, the session. 2\t Therapist elicited some feedback from the patient, but did not ask enough questions to be sure the patient understood the therapist\u2019s line of reasoning during the session or to ascertain whether the patient was satisfied with the session. 4\t Therapist asked enough questions to be sure that the patient understood the therapist\u2019s line of reasoning throughout the session and to determine the patient\u2019s reactions to the session. The therapist adjusted his/her behavior in response to the feedback when appropriate. 6\t Therapist was especially adept at eliciting and responding to verbal and nonverbal feedback throughout the session (e.g., elicited reactions to session, regularly checked for understanding, helped summarize main points at end of session). 3.\t UNDERSTANDING 0\t Therapist repeatedly failed to understand what the patient explicitly said and thus consistently missed the point. Poor empathic skills. 2\t Therapist was usually able to reflect or rephrase what the patient explicitly said, but repeatedly failed to respond to more subtle communication. Limited ability to listen and empathize. ",

Excellent listening and empathic skills. 4.\t INTERPERSONAL EFFECTIVENESS 0\t Therapist had poor interpersonal skills. Seemed hostile, demeaning, or in some other way destructive to the patient. 2\t Therapist did not seem destructive, but had significant interpersonal problems. At times, therapist appeared unnecessarily impatient, aloof, insincere or had difficulty conveying confidence and competence. 4\t Therapist displayed a satisfactory degree of warmth, concern, confidence, genuineness, and professionalism. No significant interpersonal problems. 6\t Therapist displayed optimal levels of warmth, concern, confidence, genuineness, and professionalism, appropriate for this particular patient in this session. 5.\t COLLABORATION 0\t Therapist did not attempt to collaborate with patient. 2\t Therapist attempted to collaborate with patient, but had difficulty either defining a problem that the patient considered important or establishing rapport. 4\t Therapist was able to collaborate with patient, focus on a problem that both patient and therapist considered important, and establish rapport. 6\t Collaboration seemed excellent; therapist encouraged patient as much as possible to take an active role during the session (e.g., by offering choices) so they could function as a \u201cteam.\u201d 6.\t PACING AND EFFICIENT USE OF TIME 0\t Therapist made no attempt to structure therapy time. Session seemed aimless. 2\t Session had some direction, but the therapist had significant problems with structuring or pacing (e.g., too little structure, inflexible about structure, too slowly paced, too rapidly paced). 4\t Therapist was reasonably successful at using time efficiently. Therapist maintained appropriate control over flow of discussion and pacing. 6\t Therapist used time efficiently by tactfully limiting peripheral  Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale 371 and unproductive discussion and by pacing the session as rapidly as was appropriate for the patient.

Part II. CONCEPTUALIZATION, STRATEGY, AND\u00a0TECHNIQUE 7.\t GUIDED DISCOVERY 0\t Therapist relied primarily on debate, persuasion, or \u201clecturing.\u201d Therapist seemed to be \u201ccross-examining\u201d patient, putting the patient on the defensive, or forcing his/her point of view on the patient. 2\t Therapist relied too heavily on persuasion and debate, rather than guided discovery. However, therapist\u2019s style was supportive enough that patient did not seem to feel attacked or defensive. 4\t Therapist, for the most part, helped patient see new perspectives through guided discovery (e.g., examining evidence, considering alternatives, weighing advantages and disadvantages) rather than through debate. Used questioning appropriately. 6\t Therapist was especially adept at using guided discovery during the session to explore problems and help patient draw his/ her own conclusions. Achieved an excellent balance between skillful questioning and other modes of intervention. 8.\t FOCUSING ON KEY COGNITIONS OR BEHAVIORS 0\t Therapist did not attempt to elicit specific thoughts, assumptions, images, meanings, or behaviors. 2\t Therapist used appropriate techniques to elicit cognitions or behaviors; however, therapist had difficulty finding a focus or focused on cognitions/behaviors that were irrelevant to the patient\u2019s key problems. 4\t Therapist focused on specific cognitions or behaviors relevant to the target problem. However, therapist could have focused on more central cognitions or behaviors that offered greater promise for progress. 6\t Therapist very skillfully focused on key thoughts, assumptions, behaviors, etc., that were most relevant to the problem area and offered considerable promise for progress. 9.\t STRATEGY FOR CHANGE (Note: For this item, focus on the quality of the therapist\u2019s strategy for change, not 372 Appendix C on how effectively the strategy was implemented or whether change actually occurred.) 0\t Therapist did not select cognitive-behavioral techniques. 2\t Therapist selected cognitive-behavioral techniques; however, either the overall strategy for bringing about change seemed vague or did not seem promising in helping the patient. 4\t Therapist seemed to have a generally coherent strategy for change that showed reasonable promise and incorporated cognitive-behavioral techniques. 6\t Therapist followed a consistent strategy for change that seemed very promising and incorporated the most appropriate cognitive-behavioral techniques. 10.\t APPLICATION OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL TECHNIQUES (Note: For this item, focus on how skillfully the techniques were applied, not on how appropriate they were for the target problem or whether change actually occurred.) 0\t Therapist did not apply any cognitive-behavioral techniques. 2\t Therapist used cognitive-behavioral techniques, but there were significant flaws in the way they were applied.

Homework was explained in sufficient detail. 6\t Therapist reviewed previous homework and carefully assigned homework drawn from cognitive therapy for the coming week. Assignment seemed \u201ccustom-tailored\u201d to help patient incorporate new perspectives, test hypotheses, experiment with new behaviors discussed during session, etc.  Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale 373 Part III. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 12. \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 a. Did any special problems arise during the session (e.g., nonadherence to homework, interpersonal issues between therapist and patient, hopelessness about continuing therapy, relapse)? YES NO b. If yes: 0\t Therapist could not deal adequately with special problems that arose. 2\t Therapist dealt with special problems adequately, but used strategies or conceptualizations inconsistent with cognitive therapy. 4\t Therapist attempted to deal with special problems using a cognitive framework and was moderately skillful in applying techniques. 6\t Therapist was very skillful at handling special problems using cognitive therapy framework. 13. Were there any significant unusual factors in this session that you feel justified the therapist\u2019s departure from the standard approach measured by this scale?

Concepts contained in the manual detail the basic steps needed to provide CBT (\u201cPracticing CBT 101\u201d) with the intent that users will feel increasingly comfortable administering CBT. The manual is not designed for advanced CBT practitioners. Instructional material in this program is designed to be used within the context of a psychotherapy supervisory relationship to ensure appropriate application of the training materials and timely feedback, which are viewed as critical to the development of CBT skills. The content of this manual is a compilation of foundational works on CBT, such as Judith Beck\u2019s (2011) Cognitive Therapy: Basics and Beyond, with the addition of key skills needed for developing CBT providers. The information is condensed and packaged to be highly applicable for use in a brief therapy model and to aid in rapid training. ",

The information is condensed and packaged to be highly applicable for use in a brief therapy model and to aid in rapid training. 4 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  MODULE TOPIC  1  Introduction to Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (bCBT)  2  Using Supervision  3  Therapeutic Skills in Brief CBT  4  Case Conceptualization and Treatment Planning  5  Cultural Considerations in Therapy  6  Using Technology for Distance-Based Therapy ESSENTIAL CBT SKILLS MODULE TOPIC  7  Orienting the Patient to Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  8  Goal Setting  9  Agenda Setting  10  Homework  11  Identifying Unhelpful Thinking  12  Challenging Unhelpful Thinking  13  Behavioral Activation  14  Exposure Therapy in Brief CBT  15  Problem Solving  16  Relaxation  17  Adaptation of bCBT for Special Clinical Populations  18  Ending Treatment and Maintaining Changes REFERENCES/SUGGESTED AND SUPPLEMENTAL READINGS  138 APPENDIX A: PATIENT HANDOUTS  141 APPENDIX B: SAMPLE TREATMENT OUTLINES  160 5 6 13 17 23 32 44 51 52 57 62 66 71 84 91 100 112 119 129 134 TABLE OF CONTENTS 5 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS 6 Module 1: Introduction to Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (bCBT) OBJECTIVES \u2022 To understand CBT and the process of brief CBT \u2022 To identify key treatment considerations and problems most suitable for brief CBT \u2022 To learn how to assess the patient\u2019s suitability for brief CBT What is Brief CBT, and Why Does It Require Specific Treatment Considerations? CBT combines cognitive and behavioral therapies and has strong empirical support for treating mood, sleep, chronic pain, and anxiety disorders (Hoffman & Otto, 2017; Lepping et al., 2017; Shatkin, 2018). The basic premise of CBT is that emotions are difficult to change directly, so CBT targets emotions by changing thoughts and behaviors that are contributing to the distressing emotions. Figure 1.1. Cognitive Behavioral Model  This training manual is focused on second-generation CBT (Beckian Cognitive Therapy), which focuses on using cognitive restructuring and relaxation techniques to influence behavior change.  From this perspective, we may understand situational feelings as influencing thought patterns, behavioral responses, and long-lasting emotional states. CBT builds a set of skills that enables individuals to 1. Identify how situations influence thoughts and behaviors 2. Become aware of the connection between thoughts, behaviors, and emotions 3. Improve emotional states by changing unhelpful thinking styles and behaviors linked to negative emotional sates. The process of CBT skill acquisition is collaborative. Skill acquisition and homework assignments are what set CBT apart from \u201ctalk therapies\u201d and nondirective therapies. ",

Time in session should be used to help the patient obtain skills to address the presenting problem and not simply to discuss the issue with the patient or offer advice. Identifying and changing unhelpful thoughts and behaviors sets CBT apart from third-wave therapies such as acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness-based therapies, and dialectical behavior therapy. ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 1  7 Brief CBT is the compression of CBT material and reduction of the average 12-20 sessions into four to eight sessions. In brief CBT the concentration is on specific treatments for a limited number of the patient\u2019s problems. Specificity of the treatment is required because of the limited number of sessions. Additionally, the patient is asked to be diligent in using extra reading materials and homework to assist in his or her therapeutic growth. Brief CBT can range in duration from patient to patient and provider to provider. The exact length of treatment will be determined by a host of factors involving the provider, patient, and treatment setting. Although variability exists, the table below shows an example session-by-session outline. You are encouraged to think flexibly in determining length of treatment. As indicated in the table, you are not expected to rigidly adhere to a \"set schedule\" of progress or topics but rather should be flexible and adaptive in approaching brief CBT applications. Time-limited therapy may offer additional incentives for patients and providers to work efficiently and effectively. For example, it is often helpful to work within a \"session-limited framework\" in which the patient receives four-to-six sessions of \"active\" treatment, followed by one or more follow-up sessions that occur at increasing intervals after the active-treatment phase (e.g., two weeks posttreatment with an additional booster four weeks after that).

Issues that may be addressed in primary care with brief CBT include, but are not limited to, diet, exercise, sleep, pain, medication compliance, mental health issues associated with a medical condition, and coping with a chronic illness or new diagnosis (Cully et al., 2017). Other problems may not be suitable for the use of brief CBT or may complicate a straightforward application of brief CBT. Axis II disorders, such as Borderline Personality Disorder or Antisocial Personality Disorder, are not typically appropriate for a shortened therapeutic experience, because of the pervasive social, psychological, and relational problems individuals with these disorders experience. Patients exhibiting comorbid conditions also may not be appropriate because the presence of a second issue may impede progress in therapy. For example, an individual with substance dependence secondary to major depression may not be appropriate because substance use requires a higher level of care and more comprehensive treatment than is available in a brief format. However, brief CBT could be used with Axis II and comorbid concerns in dealing with specific negative behaviors or in conjunction with more intensive treatment.

Below are important points to consider in selecting patients for brief CBT. This assessment should precede the treatment phase. It may be based on the intake assessment, input from the referral source, or a review of the medical chart. Highlight 1.1 Things to Consider in Evaluating Patients for Brief CBT 1. Strong Motivation to Change a. Increased distress is often associated with increased motivation to change. b. Positive treatment expectancies (e.g., knowledge of CBT and perceived benefits of treatment) are associated with improved outcomes. Alternatively, the patient does not have negative self-thoughts that might impede progress or change (e.g., \"Seeking care means I am crazy\u201d; \"Nothing I will do can change things\"). c. Patients who have clear goals for treatment are good candidates. 2. ",

Patient is willing to devote energy to out-of-session work (e.g., homework). 3. Life Stressors and Social Support a. Too many life stressors may lead to unfocused work and/or frequent  \"crisis-management\" interventions. b. Patients supported by family and friends are more likely to benefit. 4. Cognitive Functioning and Educational Level a. Independent homework assignments and reading materials may require adjustment according to patients\u2019 cognitive status and educational level. b. Patients able to work independently are more likely to carry out between-session work. c. Patients who are psychologically minded are more likely to benefit from short-term therapy. 5. Severity of Psychopathology a. Patients with comorbid psychopathology may be more difficult to treat in short-term therapy. In addition, some conditions such as substance abuse or serious mental illness require focused and more intensive interventions. b. Patients with an Axis II diagnosis are also less likely to benefit from short-term CBT. Long-standing interpersonal issues often require longer treatment durations. 12 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 1 SUPPLEMENTAL READINGS Beck, J.S. (2011).

Information contained in this manual will provide you with basic knowledge of CBT concepts and attempt to provide you with practical tips on how to use these concepts. However, because the provision of CBT is highly variable, depending on the provider, patient, and treatment setting, applications of CBT will need to be customized and practiced in real- world settings. This manual is, therefore, only the first step toward CBT competency. Supervision and consultation are two methods to advance CBT practice skills through routine feedback and interaction with a knowledgeable CBT provider who can serve as a trainer/consultant. What is Supervision, and Why Is It Important to CBT? Supervision is designed to a) foster the supervisee's development and b) ensure patient welfare and safety by monitoring patient care. Supervision is NOT therapy; although supervision may involve an exploration of a provider\u2019s personal experiences, such a focus is restricted to issues that influence the provider\u2019s professional work (see following table.) Table 2.1 Goals and Focus of Supervision  ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 2 For the Supervisee \u2022 Provides provider performance feedback \u2022 Provides guidance and acquisition of alternative viewpoints \u2022 Contributes to the process of forming a provider\u2019s identity \u2022 Serves as a secure base to explore applications and therapeutic principles For the Patient \u2022 Ensures that patients receive acceptable care \u00bb Providers do no harm \u00bb Providers possess sufficient skills \u00bb Those who lack skills are provided with remediation 14 SUPERVISION VERSUS CONSULTATION There is a difference between supervision and consultation. Whereas supervision involves the direct oversight of clinical cases over a period of time (often involving evaluation of the provider), consultation refers to a relationship designed to assist in professional development that does not involve formal oversight of clinical cases and may or may not continue over time. In essence, consultation involves a growth-oriented discussion of cases or issues without oversight or evaluation. When? (Indications/Contraindications) Ideally, supervision or consultation occurs on a regular basis. ",

(Indications/Contraindications) Ideally, supervision or consultation occurs on a regular basis. Typically, for providers learning CBT, supervision/consultation should occur every week or every other week. Monthly consultation meetings may be appropriate for licensed practitioners in a more advanced stage of psychotherapy training.  Supervision and/or consultation may also augment workshop-based training, with the workshop building initial skills and consultation/supervision helping the provider to deliver high-quality care during real- world applications. How? (Instructions/Handouts) The following table outlines the most common formats for supervision. The usefulness of each procedure will be determined by the goals of supervision and the supervisee\u2019s level of training and developmental needs. Exposure to multiple training modalities is seen as most effective.

CBT knowledge and practice experience \u2022 Ideally, CBT supervisors and consultants have received formal training in CBT and use CBT in their daily clinical practice. 2. Availability \u2022 For those first learning how to apply CBT, it is highly recommended that you identify supervisors/consultants who are available for weekly or bi-weekly meetings that involve anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes per meeting. The actual length of meetings can be determined by the number of cases being reviewed. \u2022 Consider logistical issues in scheduling. Would the supervisor/consultant be available for in-person or telephone sessions (in-person is more effective)? Consider proximity, travel, and availability of resources (e.g., audio/video recording). 3. Experience with a patient population similar to those you will be serving, as well as considering experience with brief or longer-term therapy. SUPPLEMENTAL READINGS Bernard, J. M. & Goodyear, R.K.

CBT is structured and goal-directed. The context is supportive, and the techniques are paired with a collaborative therapeutic stance. Therapeutic skills refer to the relationship components of therapy (e.g., rapport, installation of hope, trust, collaboration) and are comparable with treatment-specific skills that refer to the technical aspects of the psychotherapy orientation (e.g., the actual techniques such as guided imagery, thought challenging, etc.). Therapeutic skills are common within all psychotherapies and serve as the foundation for patient improvement. Refer to intervention techniques unique to the type of therapy being provided (e.g., CBT, psychodynamic, interpersonal). Studies show that therapeutic skills are responsible for a large percentage of the change associated with psychotherapy treatments. When? (Indications/Contraindications) Therapeutic skills are critical during the early stages and important at all phases of treatment. Strong therapeutic skills aid in engaging and retaining patients in psychotherapy and also strengthen the technical components of treatment. Patients who perceive the therapeutic relationship to be collaborative, safe, and trusting are in a better position to obtain benefit from the treatment, will likely be less resistant and more open to exploration and change. As treatment progresses, the therapeutic relationship should become stronger, allowing the provider and patient to gradually move into more complex and meaningful therapeutic issues. How? (Instructions/Handouts) Borrowing from person-centered therapy, this module focuses on four factors (Figure 3.1) important to the development of a strong therapeutic relationship. These factors are empathy, genuineness, and positive regard. These concepts are defined and discussed and represent general characteristics that all providers should attain in working with patients. Following a discussion of these principles, active listening is introduced as a technique to better attain a solid therapeutic relationship. EMPATHY (VALIDATING THE PATIENT'S EXPERIENCE) Empathy is the ability to understand experiences from another person\u2019s point of view. Empathy is an important part of building rapport and facilitates feelings of trust and mutual respect between the patient and provider. ",

EMPATHY (VALIDATING THE PATIENT'S EXPERIENCE) Empathy is the ability to understand experiences from another person\u2019s point of view. Empathy is an important part of building rapport and facilitates feelings of trust and mutual respect between the patient and provider. It is impossible for a provider to be knowledgeable about every patient's unique background. Empathy, which at its core 18 consists of asking questions in a respectfully curious manner and expressing emotional understanding of the answers received, is a solid first step towards understanding patients' unique life background. Additional reading about cultural differences may facilitate more informed questions and better prepare the provider for additional questions and/or rapport development. Showing empathy to patients helps to validate their experiences. Being critical, even subtly, of what patients are sharing in therapy often makes them feel judged and unwilling to disclose additional information. Use validating responses to show empathy towards a patient. Validating responses are simply statements of understanding of your patient\u2019s viewpoint. Validating responses usually entails the provider\u2019s describing what the provider heard the patient say, in a nonjudgmental manner. Figure 3.1 Developing a Strong Therapeutic Relationship GENUINENESS Genuineness is the ability to be authentic and free of deceit or judgment. You can be professional and express who you are at the same time. Genuineness helps build rapport and solidify a therapeutic relationship by allowing the patient to view the provider as a human being. Patients often assess the genuineness of the provider for credible feedback about progress in their functioning. ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 3  19 Genuineness consists of a wide variety of concepts ranging from nonverbal behaviors to overt statements. Examples of factors related to genuineness include: Supporting nonverbal behavior: Providers should be aware of their own nonverbal behaviors like keeping eye contact, giving a patient your full attention like substitute such as for like keeping eye contact, giving a patient your full attention, and nodding in agreement or understanding. It\u2019s important that these nonverbal behaviors match what is going on in the conversation, so as not to seem unnatural or inauthentic. Role behavior: CBT providers encourage patients to be active and empowered and subsequently attempt to facilitate this development through their behaviors in therapy. Providers that stress their authority in and between sessions with patients can cause a patient to feel inferior or intimidated. It is important to remember that the therapeutic relationship is one of partnership and the provider and patient work together to alleviate concerns, fears, and problems in the patient\u2019s life.

        "text": "Examples of factors related to genuineness include: Supporting nonverbal behavior: Providers should be aware of their own nonverbal behaviors like keeping eye contact, giving a patient your full attention like substitute such as for like keeping eye contact, giving a patient your full attention, and nodding in agreement or understanding. It\u2019s important that these nonverbal behaviors match what is going on in the conversation, so as not to seem unnatural or inauthentic. Role behavior: CBT providers encourage patients to be active and empowered and subsequently attempt to facilitate this development through their behaviors in therapy. Providers that stress their authority in and between sessions with patients can cause a patient to feel inferior or intimidated. It is important to remember that the therapeutic relationship is one of partnership and the provider and patient work together to alleviate concerns, fears, and problems in the patient\u2019s life. Congruence: Making sure that your words, nonverbal behavior, and feelings match each other is referred to as congruence. Not demonstrating congruence of your feelings and thoughts can become confusing or misleading to a patient. Spontaneity: This concept deals with the way the provider speaks and the timeliness of responses. Responses and feedback provided \"in the moment\" are more valuable than feedback provided at a later time. Patients are more likely to receive spontaneous messages as genuine. POSITIVE REGARD Positive regard simply means showing all patients the respect they deserve. It\u2019s essential to show patients that they are valued and that what they have to say is important. Patients who feel that their thoughts and feelings are acknowledged and understood often share more and feel more connected to the provider and the therapeutic process. Communicating positive regard may be harder than it seems, especially if you hold some negative beliefs about the person you are trying to help. Sharing any negative feelings or beliefs about your patients with your supervisor or consultant can be an excellent method to ensure that you develop and demonstrate genuine positive regard toward your patients. Commitment to the patient means that you are dedicated to working with patients on whatever issues they are bringing to therapy. This includes being on time, avoiding canceling patients\u2019 appointments, and using all efforts to help patients work through these issues. Having a nonjudgmental attitude towards the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the patient is essential. It is possible to accept and understand a perspective without necessarily agreeing with it.

Active listening is a useful technique to communicate the nonspecific factors of empathy, genuineness, and positive regard. ACTIVE LISTENING Listening to your patients is the foundation of all therapeutic approaches. Listening is made up of three steps: receiving a message, processing it, and sending it back. Providers should attempt to remain open to all messages from their patients (both verbal and nonverbal) and attempt to process as many messages as possible. Clarification: Since we all speak from our own frame of reference, messages we send to others may not be received in the way we intend. Clarification is a useful and necessary tool for all providers. Clarification can be used to help simplify a message that is being sent by patients or to help confirm the accuracy of what providers think they have understood. In-Session Example 3.1 Notice that the clarifying statement and question helped the provider and patient to more fully explore her feelings and thoughts. Given this new information, the provider is in a better position to explore the patient's concerns and to set up targeted efforts and strategies for treatment. Paraphrasing and Reflection: These techniques involve restating the patient\u2019s main thoughts in a different way or reflecting back the emotions the patient is currently experiencing to gain depth or clarification. Patient  I just do not feel like trying any more. Provider: Tell me more about what you mean. Patient:  I just feel like giving up Provider: Do you mean giving up on your goal to complete college; or are you  referring to something different, like giving up on life and possibly  harming yourself? Patient:  I am not referring to suicide, if that is what you mean; but I am feeling  really depressed. Each day seems like such a struggle, and I often just  feel like staying in bed. When I said \u201cgive up,\u201d I guess I was referring to  not wanting to face all the struggles I face in life \u2026 my school work,  financial problems, relationship problems, etc. 21 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 3 In-Session Example 3.2  In this example of paraphrasing, the provider gives back to the patient what he or she heard, which allows the patient to hear her own words and react with a more detailed response.

The use of paraphrasing in this example facilitated a deeper understanding of the issue but also conveyed to the patient a feeling of being heard and understood. Listening for Themes and Summary Statements: Often, patients express thoughts, feelings and behaviors that become thematic across situations. Although novice providers may initially have difficulties identifying this thematic content, repetition over time (e.g., across sessions) usually helps to create a clearer picture of the salient therapeutic issues that require attention or focus. With experience, providers become more effective and efficient at identifying thematic content. Once identified, thematic content can be a very powerful mechanism to influence treatment outcomes. Summarization is the technique that brings thematic content into the purview of the patient. Summarization is a condensed phrasing of the patient\u2019s responses over a specific period of time (e.g., across the session, since the outset of treatment, since the onset of his/her current difficulties.) You should rephrase the themes, and repeat them back to the patient for clarification. BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES TO BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP Setting limits in an empathetic manner is an essential tool for new providers. Many new providers desire to \u201cmake it all better,\u201d in that they may coddle and console the patient and are distracted from working on deeper issues. A provider can create a holding environment through empathetic words and active listening. A holding environment is a setting in which the patient feels like he or she is being heard and that he or she is in a safe and secure place to voice thoughts and feelings without judgment. Moving from rapport and relationship building to assessment and goal setting can be challenging.

Provider: You are really struggling to feel better, and much of your pain comes  from the grief and loss you feel from losing your fianc\u00e9. You may  even be questioning whether or not this pain will subside because it  is getting unmanageable. Patient:  Yes, that is correct.

Often, however, patients and providers are not speaking the same language. For example, a provider may feel most comfortable when tackling a certain issue first; whereas a patient may wish to focus on a different problem first. When the provider and patient are not in congruence regarding goals, the move between rapport building and goal setting is strained. To overcome this issue, providers are encouraged to use motivational interviewing strategies (see Rollnick, Butler, and Mason \u2013 Chapters 3, 4, and 5). Primary techniques involve listening to the patient, following the patient's lead and/or motivation, and setting collaborative and mutually agreed-upon goals. A vital aspect to transitioning from rapport to goal setting involves assessing the importance, confidence, and readiness of the patient about specific treatment goals (see Goal Setting, Module 8).

Case conceptualization also aids in establishing rapport and a sense of hope for patients. Case conceptualization is vital to effective treatment and represents a defining characteristic of expert providers. Using these skills, providers are better able to define a treatment plan using intervention techniques that provide the best opportunities for change. This focused and informed approach provides the roadmap for both patients and providers and should include a foundation for assessing change/progress using measurement-based care principles. Case conceptualization (Figure 4.1) is particularly important for short-term therapy, as it serves to focus both the patient and clinician on the salient issues to avoid ancillary problems that often serve as distractions to core goals.

How? (Instructions/Handouts) 1. CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION STEP 1: Assessing Patient Concerns/Difficulties The patient\u2019s presenting concerns and current functioning can be assessed in a number of different ways. The following section outlines several possible avenues for identifying problems/concerns. A) Using established self-report symptom inventories. A common practice in CBT involves the use of self-report symptom measures to assess baseline functioning as well as therapeutic progress. Frequently used measures for depression and anxiety include the Beck Depression Inventory \u2013 Second Edition, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression), Geriatric Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale. Self-report measures are often completed by patients while in the waiting room and evaluated by the clinician during the session. Often self-report measures can serve as a routine agenda item during CBT sessions and highlight important improvements and/or continuing symptoms. Information obtained from these self-report inventories can also provide insight into the way the patient thinks and behaves and factors that might be important areas of need and will inform treatment progress and treatment continuation/discontinuation. B) Problem lists. These are a common and useful strategy for identifying the psychological, social, occupational, and financial difficulties faced by patients. ",

B) Problem lists. These are a common and useful strategy for identifying the psychological, social, occupational, and financial difficulties faced by patients. Providers who use problem lists typically elicit a list of five to 10 difficulties from the patient during the first part of session 1. Problems are best identified using open-ended questions (e.g., \u201cWhat brings you to this clinic?\u201d \u201cWhat issues would you like to focus on in our work together?\u201d). Problems are best described in terms of symptom frequency (How often does the symptom occur?), intensity (How mild or severe is it?) and functional impact (What influence does the symptom have on daily functioning or general distress?). ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 4 25 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 4 Some patients may describe their difficulties or goals in vague or abstract ways, such as, \u201cI want to improve my life,\u201d or I want to be happy again.\u201d Problems and subsequent goals are best described in specific terms to maintain clinical focus. For example, specific problems are listed in the following table. Table 4.1 Problem List Example C) Assessing cognitions. Within the CBT model, it is often helpful to examine the patient\u2019s thoughts, especially how the patient perceives them. A commonly used, structured way to examine these factors is to assess (ask questions related to) how the patients perceives themselves. For example, a patient might self-describe as incapable, not useful, or a burden. They may generally perceive others to be critical or hard to please. And their view of the future might be largely pessimistic and involve beliefs that the future will include only more losses and disappointments (see also Thought Records in Modules 11 and 12). D) Assessing behaviors and precipitating situations. Precipitating situations are events, behaviors, thoughts, or emotions that activate, trigger, or compound patient difficulties. The Antecedents, Behavior, Consequences (ABC) Model is a model for examining behavior (symptoms) in a larger context. It postulates that behaviors are largely determined by antecedents (events that precede behavior/thoughts/mood) and consequences (events that follow the behavior/thoughts/mood). The ABC model (see worksheet at the end of this module) is used in a functional assessment. It follows the premise that behavior (B) is shaped by antecedents (A) and consequences (C). The antecedent occurs before a behavior and may be a trigger for a particular reaction in the patient. ",

Behavior is any activity (even a thought or feeling) that the patient exhibits in response to an antecedent. Consequences are events that occur after the behavior and direct the patient to either continue or discontinue the behavior. Problem Frequency Severity Impact Social Isolation Stay at home six of seven days Limited social contacts: moderate-to-severe isolation Highly distressing; socially debilitating; estranged family/friends Pain Experience pain each hour Pain intensity is high, 7 out of 10, when present Pain leading to decreased activity level, inability to work Feelings of Worthlessness Occur three of seven days Very intense when present; sometimes involve suicidal thoughts Highly distressing; influence work, social, and intimate relationships Fatigue Occurs almost constantly Not intense but troublesome Decreased activity level, frequent naps, inability to complete daily tasks 26 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 4 Two kinds of consequences are examined in a functional assessment: short-term and long-term consequences. A) Antecedents: Antecedents, or events that occur before a behavior, typically elicit emotional and physiological responses. Antecedents may be affective (an emotion), somatic (a physiological response), behavioral (an act), or cognitive (a thought). They are also subject to contextual (situational) and relational (interpersonal) factors. For example, patients who report depressed mood (emotion) may feel bad when they are alone at home late at night (contextual antecedent) or better when they are around family (relational antecedent). Alternatively, they may feel depressed by thinking, \u201cI will always be alone\u201d (cognitive antecedent). It\u2019s important to remember that antecedents can both increase and decrease a particular behavior. To help your patiens identify antecedents, teach them to pinpoint conditions that affect their behavior. In-Session Example 4.1 \u201cWhat were you feeling right before you did that?\u201d (Affective) \u201cWhat happens to you physically before this happens? Do you feel sick?\u201d (Somatic) \u201cHow do you normally act right before this happens?\u201d (Behavioral) \u201cWhat thoughts go through your mind before this happens?\u201d (Cognitive) \u201cWhere and when does this usually happen?\u201d (Contextual) \u201cDo you do this with everyone, or just when you are around certain people?\u201d (Relational) B) Behaviors: A behavior is anything the patient does, feels, or thinks immediately following the antecedent. Each behavior that your patient displays could potentially include an affective component (feelings or moods), a somatic component (bodily sensations such as rapid heartbeat or stomachache), a behavioral component (what a patient does or doesn\u2019t do), and a cognitive component (thoughts or beliefs).

C) Consequences: Consequences are categorized as being either positive or negative. Positive consequences increase the chances that a behavior will be repeated through the experience of something pleasant or the removal of something negative (e.g., do not have to do a chore). Negative consequences decrease the occurrence of a behavior, either by the presence of something noxious (e.g., being yelled at) or the absence of something desired (e.g., a child being grounded from watching TV). Patients tend to repeat behaviors that result in something positive or the removal of something negative. Identifying Consequences. Similarly to identifying antecedents, when you and a patient are attempting to identify the consequences of a certain behavior, it is important to explore all components of each consequence. 27 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 4 In-Session Example 4.2 \u201cHow do you feel immediately after this occurs?\u201d (Affective) \u201cDo you have any bodily sensations after this happens, like trembling?\u201d (Somatic) \u201cHow do you react after this behavior occurs? (Behavioral) \u201cWhat do you think about after this happens?\u201d (Cognitive) \u201cAre you in a different place when this behavior ends?\u201d (Contextual) \u201cAre there any people who make this behavior worse? Make it better?\u201d (Relational) When completing a functional assessment, examine both short- and long-term consequences. Short-term consequences tend to be behavioral reinforcers, while long- term consequences tend to be negative outcomes. In the case of addiction, the short- term consequence of using a substance is intoxication, or escape from a negative mood; the long-term consequence may be legal trouble, family problems, or a hangover. Understanding the positive and negative consequences of a behavior for a patient helps design the timing and nature of intervention. For example, in the case above, an intervention would need to follow a noxious antecedent to offset the negative mood it causes. Treating the negative mood would then decrease the need for escape through substance use. A variety of questions may be used to elucidate a short-term consequence: In-Session Example 4.3 \u201cDoes this behavior get you attention in some way?\u201d \u201cWhat good things happen as a result of this behavior?\u201d \u201cDoes this help you in some way?\u201d \u201cDo you feel a certain \u2018rush\u2019 from doing this?\u201d \u201cDoes this behavior help you avoid something you don\u2019t want to do?\u201d 2.

CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION STEP 2: Clinical Hypotheses and Treatment Plan Establishing focused clinical hypotheses based upon the information obtained in Case Conceptualization Step #1 serves to direct intervention options and possible treatment techniques. These hypotheses may require adaptation as new information becomes available during treatment. Clinical hypotheses can either be used exclusively by the provider or can be shared with patients. Generally, sharing this information improves trust and communication between patient and provider. A focused clinical hypothesis for a person with depression might be as follows: \"Since your retirement, you have experienced many life transitions and numerous losses (e.g., financial, social, functional). Your thoughts, which used to be largely positive and ambitious, are now negative and pessimistic; and you appear to be fearful of the future. In 28 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 4 reaction to your mood and negative thoughts, you have reduced the number of your activities; and you have begun to withdraw from your family.\"The end result of case conceptualization is formation of a treatment plan, an agreed-upon strategy between patient and provider that gives direction to the therapeutic process. A treatment plan should include a presentation of the causes of the patient's current difficulties (e.g., cognitive and behavioral factors creating symptoms or difficulties) and a specific plan. When presenting the plan, actively involve the patient and incorporate his or her feedback. In-Session Example 4.4 Example: \u201cIn the brief amount of time we have spent together, it appears that we have identified some thoughts and behaviors that are likely contributing to your current difficulties. In particular, your view of yourself and your future are quite negative; and you have stopped doing many things that used to bring you pleasure. My recommendation would be to further explore your thoughts and see if we can find a more balanced view of your current difficulties. I would also like to talk with you more about re-engaging in activities you used to find pleasurable. What do you think about these targets for therapy?\"3. CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION STEP 3: Identifying Possible Treatment Obstacles It is not uncommon for patients to simply agree with recommendations from their provider. However, it is important to identify potential obstacles to treatment early on to avoid setbacks or treatment failures. ",

CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION STEP 3: Identifying Possible Treatment Obstacles It is not uncommon for patients to simply agree with recommendations from their provider. However, it is important to identify potential obstacles to treatment early on to avoid setbacks or treatment failures. Asking for frequent feedback from the patient helps to reduce over-compliance and serves to include the patient in a collaborative and active treatment approach. As part of this collaborative venture, it is important to ask patients whether they see any potential obstacles to treatment. Barriers might include logistic difficulties (financial, travel), personal beliefs (concerns about stigma, effectiveness of treatment) or interpersonal issues (family not supportive of therapy). 29 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 4 Highlight 4.1 Tips for Using Case Conceptualization in Brief Therapy \u2022 Case conceptualization in brief CBT is much the same as with longer forms of treatment, with the following exceptions: \u00bb Brief therapy leaves little room for delays in case formulation. \u00bb The time constraints of brief therapy must be considered in all treatment/ goal- setting endeavors. Treatment goals should be reasonable, measurable and as simple as possible. \u00bb Because of limited time, the focus of treatment in brief CBT also generally limits the depth of cognitive interventions. For example, it is quite frequent to address automatic thoughts and intermediate beliefs as foci of treatment, while addressing core beliefs is often difficult. If core beliefs are addressed, this usually occurs indirectly through more surface-level intervention techniques or at a time when the patient is particularly ready for such work. Homework Assignment Examples 1. Think about our agreed-upon treatment plan, and consider any adjustments it  might need. 2. Make a list of any obstacles to therapy that may arise.

Culture defines individuals\u2019 specific \u201cways of being\u201d that are shaped by the intersection of their identity and their lived experiences. Culture influences our behaviors and impacts our lifestyle choices, which is why it is an important factor in psychotherapy and therapeutic relationships. Not only should providers become aware of patients\u2019 unique cultures, but they should also consider their own culture to form genuine and effective therapeutic relationships. Cultural recognition and appreciation begin with an understanding of an individual\u2019s race, age, and gender; however, culture goes much deeper. Although two individuals may have similar physical identifiers of culture, past experiences and unseen forms of culture can create differences. For example, two Mexican American men may look the same and even be in the same age group. However, they may have grown up with different religions, in different socioeconomic groups, one with a single father and the other with two parents and his grandmother living in the home. Table 5.1 is an inexhaustive list of cultural identifiers that influence an individual\u2019s culture. 33 Table 5.1. ",

Conformity (All) Everyone \u201cconforms\u201d to the majority society to emulate the way the majority acts, speaks, dresses, and believes, because the majority is perceived as positive. Stage II. Minority Group Majority Group Dissonance The minority group realizes that its race or gender may preclude it from the benefits of the majority group. It begins to see that racism and sexism may be impacting it. Acceptance The majority group can diminish comments or actions that indicate racism or sexism is alive. It feels the minority should be more like it or dismiss the effects of minority status. Stage III. Immersion Due to the effects of racism and sexism, members of minority groups begin to feel negative emotions towards the majority group. Resistance Members of majority group may feel that racism and sexism do not exist and can express beliefs about \u201creverse racism\u201d or \u201creverse sexism.\u201d Stage IV. Emersion Anger towards the majority group causes minorities to associate only with the group they belong to, avoiding contact with the majority. Retreat When the majority group\u2019s assumptions about minorities are proven false, it may feel guilt and shame about how difficult life is for minorities. It may also feel frustration towards other members of its own group who do not agree. Stage V. Internalization Minority groups realize that there are negative qualities about their own people and that not all members of the majority group are the enemy. They begin to see that racism and sexism can be fought against. Emergence Members of the majority start to understand their privilege and how it continues to benefit them. Stage VI. Integrative Awareness (All) Both majority and minority group members positively identify their own cultural/racial identity and acknowledge other aspects of both their own and others\u2019 identities.

Table 5.2 Integrated Model of Cultural/Racial Development (Hoffman & Hoffman, 2006) 36 CULTURE AND PSYCHOTHERAPY The goal of culturally competent psychotherapy is to ensure that patients\u2019 experiences and culture are considered when providing care. Optimal care is achieved when both the provider and patient are collaborative in the treatment. Appropriate consideration of patients\u2019 backgrounds and experiences results in patients\u2019 feeling heard and understood, creating a safe space for patients to express themselves. Acknowledging your patient\u2019s culture provides an opportunity to fully understand the patient and conveys a level of openness that encourages discussion and exploration of other factors important in the psychotherapy process. Traditional CBT and Western models of psychotherapy typically have not considered or accounted for ethnic and cultural values and beliefs of patients. Historically, minority patients have high dropout rates, due to various challenges to care, such as: 1. Psychotherapy can feel \u201cforeign\u201d to non-Western or underrepresented groups because emotional expression and discussing personal experiences may conflict with certain values. For example, some groups view expressing emotions as weak or unstable.  Also, some may view discussing themselves as rude or insensitive to others. 2. Inflexible use of manualized treatments can feel impersonal and too formal for patients, limiting the possibility for patients to feel like a collaborative partner in their care. Manualized treatments are developed to be efficacious and are typically not created to be culturally sensitive. 3. When mismatch between the provider and patient\u2019s gender, race, age, etc. are not appropriately acknowledged, it can limit patients\u2019 comfort in expressing themselves. When? (Indications/Contraindications) You should be aware of your patients\u2019 and your own cultural identity. Given the importance of the therapeutic relationship in psychotherapy, it is critical to not only communicate and model nonspecific factors (e.g., warmth, genuineness) but also consider culture and factors of diversity as a process that occurs initially and throughout the therapy process. IMPACT OF CULTURE ON MENTAL HEALTH Look to minimize any negative outcomes associated with the intersection of culture and mental health. The Transactional Model of Stress and Coping (Figure 5.1.) describes how patients react or appraise stressful situations or triggering events and, subsequently, how they seek to cope with those stressors, based on their initial appraisal. Patients appraise situations through their own cultural lens, based on their own past experiences of coping and the experiences of others close to them. ",

Patients appraise situations through their own cultural lens, based on their own past experiences of coping and the experiences of others close to them. In addition, stressors and triggering events can be cultural in nature. For example, experiencing discrimination at work or receiving a life-altering medical diagnosis or physical/mental disability impacts both our culture and our mental health. If you are aware and accepting of cultural differences when assessing and treating mental health issues, you will be better informed and in tune with your patients\u2019 needs. ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 5 37 Figure 5.1: The Transactional Model of Stress and Coping (Folkman, Lazarus, Gruen, & DeLongis, 1986) EVALUATION OF PATIENTS\u2019 CULTURE Although providers are experts in mental health and mental health treatment, patients are experts of their own identity and life experiences. To provide treatment, providers should understand and be willing to explore each patient\u2019s lived experiences. Do not assume that culture will always play a role in patients\u2019 psychopathology. Provide your patients with the opportunity to hypothesize how aspects of their culture may play a role. Examples of how to begin these conversations are provided below. Important to note: the patients may be clear as to how culture influences their symptoms, ongoing stressors, or presenting concerns. Therefore, understanding patients\u2019 experiences may be more helpful for the provider than the patient. EVALUATION OF PROVIDER\u2019S CULTURE In addition to cultural considerations of the patient, consider your own cultural experiences. All individuals have unique experiences and backgrounds that may differ from another\u2019s. Evaluating your own cultural experiences and past behaviors will inform ways in which you may interact with patients of different backgrounds. Personal experiences contribute to explicit and implicit biases, which impact how individuals interact with others. ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 5  38 PATIENT AND PROVIDER INTERACTION The interaction of two cultures often leads to cultural differences. Under ideal circumstances, cultural differences create opportunities for individuals to learn about others\u2019 cultures, highlight commonalities among shared cultural experiences, and develop awareness of differing experiences. However, cultural differences can also lead to negative experiences and outcomes, such as discrimination, stereotypes, and injustice. Providers and patients bring their own lived experiences to the therapeutic relationship, but it is imperative to model behaviors that attend to cultural differences. This may be the first time your patient is introduced to the concept of cultural difference and, thus, negative outcomes can be directed towards you. Just as patients can be negatively impacted by not acknowledging culture, you as a provider can be discriminated or stereotyped. ",

This may be the first time your patient is introduced to the concept of cultural difference and, thus, negative outcomes can be directed towards you. Just as patients can be negatively impacted by not acknowledging culture, you as a provider can be discriminated or stereotyped. Both you and your patient may experience discrimination. Discrimination is the mistreatment of individuals based on societal or personal views of an aspect of their culture being inferior. Discrimination can be direct, such as overt racism and sexism, or indirect, such as microaggressions. Microaggressions are intentional or unintentional slights or behaviors directed towards others that indicate social inferiority, hostility, or derogation. For example, a teacher telling parents of an African American student that she is so articulate and well mannered may be an unintentional microaggression. Even though the teacher is trying to compliment the student, the teacher may be making a microaggression because of the underlying societal stereotype that African American students would present otherwise. Both providers and patients should attend to the possibility of microaggressions and discuss any occurrences as much as possible in the moment.  Awareness of explicit and implicit biases presented in Table 5.3 can help prevent microaggressions and discrimination from occurring. Table 5.3 Example of Explicit and Implicit Bias ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 5 39 Table 5.3 Biases How? (Instructions/Handouts) You can use many techniques and methods to explicitly integrate culture into psychotherapy in both extended and brief treatment contexts. The following sections provide guidance and techniques to assist you when attending to culture and integrating culture into your practice. ORIENT THE PATIENT TO BRIEF, TECHNICAL TREATMENT. Discuss the patient\u2019s perspective of therapy and any perceived barriers: \u2022 What are your thoughts about coming to psychotherapy? What do you want to know about therapy? What do you think about providers? Have you been in therapy before? \u2022 How does your family view psychotherapy? Your friends? Your partner? Do they know ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 5 Explicit Bias Definition: Attitudes and beliefs we have about a person or group on a conscious level. Individuals are aware of this bias and express it directly. Implicit Bias Definition: Attitudes and beliefs we have about a person or group on an unconscious level. Individuals are unaware of this bias and express it subconsciously. General Examples: \u2022 A boss choosing not to interview an applicant after seeing the applicant\u2019s dreadlocks.

Examples in Psychotherapy: \u2022 A female provider choosing to refer a transgender patient to her LGBT colleague, because she assumes she would not be able to understand the patient\u2019s needs. She assumes the patient\u2019s presenting concerns will be tied to being transgender. \u2022 A male provider skipping over the military sexual trauma questions during an assessment with a male veteran. He assumes only female veterans experience military sexual trauma. \u2022 A White provider being friendlier with White patients than with patients of color. \u2022 Appearing concerned or sad when a middle- aged female patient says she is single and does not have any children, assuming that being single would contribute to a negative emotional state. 40 that you are coming to therapy? If so, what do/would they say? How do they view people who attend therapy? \u2022 What are ways therapy may be difficult for you?

Exploring patients\u2019 culture can be difficult to achieve in time-limited therapy. It is common for a brief CBT provider to feel tension between sticking to the brief CBT therapy protocol and providing patients with enough time to expand on their experiences and concerns. However, most protocols emphasize the importance of building rapport; and addressing culture can help you build this therapeutic alliance. The exact \u201cbalance\u201d between listening/assessing and forming a strong therapeutic relationship with the time necessary to deliver technical/skill-focused interventions will depend on many factors, including the needs of the patient, the duration of treatment, and the provider\u2019s skillfulness in rapidly and effectively forming a strong relationship while maintaining a focus on active, skill-oriented techniques.

ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 5 41 Cultural Faux Pas Assuming pronouns/identifiers \u00bb Always ask about how individuals identify or how they\u2019d prefer to be addressed. An individual\u2019s race and gender may not match stereotypical classifications. Example: he/she/they; Black/African American/Afro Caribbean; Mexican American/Latino/Hispanic Using illegal immigrant or illegal alien \u00bb Use undocumented citizen or undocumented immigrant. Confusing gender and sexual orientation \u00bb Gender and sexual orientation are not correlated. Transgender individuals can identify as any sexual orientation, regardless of their gender or natal sex. Acknowledging the \u201cplight\u201d of living with disability \u00bb Referring to the strength or courage of someone living with a disability can come off as offensive and can minimize their identity.

ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 5 Highlight 5.1 YOUR APPROACH DURING TREATMENT SHOULD SHIFT, BASED ON YOUR PATIENT\u2019S PRESENTATION. Providers use language during treatment based on their training, their theoretical orientation, and their own cultural experiences. However, often technical language, jargon, and various descriptors can make patients feel uncomfortable. Use your patients\u2019 language and cues to shift your approach and be more aligned with them. Some examples include referring to the treatment process as talk therapy or counseling instead of psychotherapy, describing the patient\u2019s issues or concerns (e.g., \u201cI am no longer able to do what I used to do\u201d) compared to symptoms used for diagnoses, using the term client rather than patient (taking into consideration the clinical context of your work), or referencing stressors instead of situations or triggers. 42 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 5 CONSIDER V-CODES WHEN MAKING DIAGNOSES.

These diagnoses are called \u201cother conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention\u201d and are referred to as \u201cV Codes\u201d in the ICD-9-CM and \u201cZ Codes\u201d in the ICD-10-CM. Some of the diagnoses include:  Tips 1. Engage in life-long learning and professional growth.  This brief chapter scratches only the surface of cultural awareness in psychotherapy. Ongoing training throughout your career will ensure that you are continuing to grow and develop your awareness of culture. 2. \u201cCultural competency\u201d is an evolving process. Due to the variable nature of human behavior and the complexity of culture, individuals will never reach full cultural competency and awareness. Your goal should be to practice being culturally competent, not assume that you have cultural competency. 3. Be curious. While exploring your own and your patients\u2019 culture, be appropriately curious about culture. When struggling with what is appropriate or inappropriate, consider your patient\u2019s perspective. What questions would you be OK with answering or being asked? Relational Problems \u2022 Parent-Child Relational Problem \u2022 Upbringing Away from Parents \u2022 Relationship Distress with Spouse/ Intimate Partner \u2022 Uncomplicated Bereavement Social Problems \u2022 Target of (Perceived) Adverse Discrimination or Persecution \u2022 Acculturation Difficulty \u2022 Social Exclusion or Rejection \u2022 Problem Related to Living Alone Medical or Health Care Access Problems \u2022 Unavailability or Inaccessibility of Health Care Facilities \u2022 Unavailability or Inaccessibility of Helping Agencies Environmental or Psychosocial Problems \u2022 Religious or Spiritual Problem \u2022 Victim of Terrorism or Torture \u2022 Exposure to Disaster or War Educational/Occupational Problems \u2022 Academic or Educational Problem \u2022 Problem Related to Current Military Deployment Status \u2022 Problem Related to Employment Housing and Economic Problems \u2022 Homelessness or Inadequate Housing \u2022 Extreme Poverty or Low Income \u2022 Problem Related to Living in a Residential Institution \u2022 Lack of Adequate Food or Safe Drinking Water 43 ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 5 SUPPLEMENTAL READINGS & REFERENCES American Psychiatric Association.

Conducting therapy with technology-based modalities has rapidly increased for mental health care. Specifically, using technology-based approaches as a means for providing psychological services has served to reduce mental health disparities and overcome distance-based barriers. Telemental health is the practice of using technology to provide mental health services and may include telephone, two-way video conferencing, mobile phone applications, web-based text messaging, email-based interventions, web-based chat messaging, or asynchronous telepsychiatry (formerly store-and-forward services). These remote telecommunication modalities present opportunities to enhance mental health care through services offered clinic to clinic (e.g., provider located in one clinic while the patient is physically present at a different clinic location) as well as from a provider directly into patients\u2019 homes or other secure locations. Telemental health services may be used effectively across an array of settings including, but not limited to, hospitals, short- and long-term care facilities, school systems, institutional correctional facilities, rural health centers, and community mental health clinics. Telemental health modalities are associated with clinical effectiveness, treatment adherence, patient and provider satisfaction, psychotherapeutic alliance outcomes, and cost effectiveness commensurate with services provided face-to-face.

Telemental health modalities are associated with clinical effectiveness, treatment adherence, patient and provider satisfaction, psychotherapeutic alliance outcomes, and cost effectiveness commensurate with services provided face-to-face. Telemental health services are useful in providing evidence-based psychotherapies to individuals, groups, and families. When? (Indications/Contraindications) Technological advances and the subsequent integration into healthcare services have made remote delivery of mental health care accessible to underserved and disadvantaged populations. Telemental health services help minimize barriers that prevent patients\u2019 access to care when they need it (see Figure 6.1). When traditional face-to-face therapies are unavailable or inaccessible, alternative treatment modalities may be appropriate for individuals that frequently travel for work, those who serve during military deployments, and people who work irregular schedules. 45 Figure 6.1 Barriers to Mental Care Access CONSIDERATIONS Potential risks of using technological modalities when providing remote mental health treatment must be considered. Risks involve the need for crises management procedures as well as clinical issues, including the potential for negative impact on patient functioning. For example, patients with anxiety may have fears associated with avoidance that are potentially maintained by using telehealth services and thereby reducing exposure to feared stimuli (e.g., going out of the house). Additional precautions may be warranted to effectively observe and assess mobility (e.g., ask the patient to walk across the room in front of the camera) and hygiene (e.g., inquire about the last time a patient showered or brushed their teeth). Patients may be offered various telemental health modalities, but it is the provider\u2019s responsibility to ensure alignment with the patient\u2019s presenting concerns as well as to be knowledgeable about data to support the intervention using the selected delivery method. Some smartphone applications, for example, provide treatment programs that are not empirically supported. Despite concerns about the appropriateness of technology- based modalities, telemental health services have been used successfully across an array of populations. ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 6  46 \u2022 Age Group: Research has been conducted on telemental health with all age groups. Providers should determine whether patients can effectively use a desired telemental health modality through direct conversations with patients about acceptability and feasibility. Occasionally, patients from various age groups (e.g., older adults) may require some education on how to use different modalities. Typically, younger patients are more likely to desire technology-based treatment. However, patients of all age groups can be instructed on how to use technology for treatment. ",

Occasionally, patients from various age groups (e.g., older adults) may require some education on how to use different modalities. Typically, younger patients are more likely to desire technology-based treatment. However, patients of all age groups can be instructed on how to use technology for treatment. \u2022 High Risk Populations: Clinical concerns arise when providing telemental health to patients who endorse current suicidal ideation or substance use. For patients with past suicidal ideation, consider the level of suicide risk, the length of time since the last reported episode of suicidal ideation, and the number of past episodes when deciding the appropriateness of telemental health. High risk patients in crisis often require focused and highly intensive treatment approaches that may make weekly therapy inappropriate. However, telehealth modalities may be an important element of a broader treatment approach that includes a mixture of face-to-face and virtual appointments.  Ultimately, the decision to use telemental health with high-risk patients should be based upon clinical expertise; and a clear emergency plan should always be identified (i.e., emergency contact, involving family and friends). \u2022 Patients with Severe Mental Illness: Telemental health can be conducted with patients who have been diagnosed with severe mental illnesses. However, patients who are not adherent to psychotropic medication or other treatment recommendations may not be appropriate for telemental health treatment. Distance may pose an ethical risk in ensuring the safety of your patient. As with high-risk suicide patients, the use of telemental health procedures for those with serious mental illness may be most effective as part of a interdisciplinary treatment plan. \u2022 Rural or Out-of-State Population: Telemental health is an optimal option for rural populations that do not have access to treatment. However, different states have regulations on providing treatment across state lines, which should be considered. \u2022 Exposure-Based Treatment: Telemental health services can increase effectiveness of treatment of anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. Patients can use technology in their environment, allowing you to guide them through relevant exposure exercises. \u2022 Treatment-Avoidant Populations: Telemental health options engage patients that may not otherwise use therapy. However, these care options can reinforce avoidance and limit patient progress in treatment. Use your clinical judgment to determine if a patient high in avoidance or low in motivation is appropriate for telemental health throughout the course of treatment.

ESSENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPY SKILLS  |  MODULE 6 47 PRIVACY Consider the environment of your patient to ensure appropriate levels of privacy during treatment. Telemental health services are an option for patients that have access to reliable, private technology software, especially if transportation is an issue. Stay-at- home parents or caretakers may have issues in connecting that are contingent upon their caregiver duties or responsibilities. Additionally, ensure that your facility or office has designated areas to conduct telephone or video sessions. It is important to ensure secure network connections and video conferencing software to meet privacy standards and HIPAA requirements. How? (Instructions/Handouts) Providing telemental health services using technology can be a complicated process, and you should consider it on a case-by-case basis. As with any new procedure, you are encouraged to explore and be knowledgeable in the modalities and delivery. You must be vigilant and prepared (proactive) when using telehealth procedures. Various factors can be considered when using telemental health: ASSESSING PATIENT SAFETY Although no condition-specific populations are currently considered inappropriate for telemental health services, individual patient safety should always be considered before providing services through any telemental health modality. Current best practices include: 1. Assessing patient\u2019s current and past suicidal ideation 2. Obtaining emergency contact information for the patient as well as others that may be at the same location of the patient during each session 3. Obtaining the patient\u2019s physical location and address for the duration of the session 4. Obtaining contact information for the patient\u2019s local emergency services and law enforcement agencies (see American Psychiatric Association, American Telemedicine Association, and American Psychological Association in Resources) 5. Routine safety planning, which includes continuous monitoring of environmental changes such as patient\u2019s appearance and sobriety level, as well as access to lethal means 6. Establishment of crisis protocols, with consideration as to how these protocols may require deviations considering domestic violence situations and/or with patients located at settings other than those originally anticipated (e.g., patients may change locations to the home of a relative, friend, or other setting) DETERMINING APPROPRIATENESS OF THE PATIENT\u2019S CASE Prospective telehealth providers are strongly encouraged to engage in self-assessment related to the provision of psychotherapeutic services across an array of telehealth modalities. It is important to review issues spanning state and regulatory licensure, technology, ethics, professional relationships, and specific training requirements (STEPS) before providing telehealth services (See Table 6.1).

You must consider patient comfort and familiarity with technology as a patient\u2019s willingness to engage. Your patient\u2019s opinion of telehealth modalities impacts outcomes of implementation and efficacy of service delivery. Additionally, it is important to consider only technologies that are accessible, practical, and feasible for the patient because a patient\u2019s familiarity with technology may impact their view of a clinical professional (e.g., some patients may prefer in-person or technology-assisted clinical interactions). The primary and secondary language of the provider and patient may impact service delivery such that a telephone- based or in-person interpreter may be necessary. Finally, providing care through any technology-based delivery system will not be effective if you do not ensure availability of time and resources before offering contact, communication and care. You must be able to provide and maintain quality, consistent care for services to be effective. TIPS FOR CONDUCTING A TELEMENTAL HEALTH SESSION \u2022 Conduct a practice telesession before your first session with the patient. This will decrease the likelihood of equipment failure and allow you and the patient to become comfortable with the modality before the treatment session. Some facilities offer services that will conduct practice calls with patients before sessions with providers. \u2022 Look directly into the camera if you are conducting a video session, instead of at the patient\u2019s image onscreen, to ensure good eye contact. \u2022 Pay attention to your surrounding background area, and remove anything that may be distracting on camera. \u2022 Wear plain clothing without busy patterns (e.g., plaid, geometric shapes) or bright colors. \u2022 Obtain patient\u2019s emergency contact information at the beginning of every telemental health session and keep this information readily available through the session duration. \u2022 Verify patient\u2019s physical address/location at the beginning of each appointment and note any changes that occur during the session. You should also take note of local emergency service information in the locality of the patient. PLEASE NOTE: If you call 911, you will be connected to emergency services where you are located. This can cause an unnecessary and potentially dangerous delay. ",

OVERCOMING BARRIERS Providers who are unfamiliar with technology are often reluctant to provide psychotherapeutic interventions through technology-based modalities, due to fear of hampering the therapeutic alliance (e.g., communicating warmth, understanding, sensitivity, and empathy). Although specific challenges to providing telemental health services do exist (see Table 6.2), both providers and mental health patients have observed the therapeutic alliance over distance-based technologies to be comparable with that of face-to-face clinical interactions.

Orienting the patient to therapy involves: \u2022 A discussion of the theory underlying brief CBT \u2022 A description of how the presenting problems can be conceptualized and treated with this approach \u2022 Education about the structure, format, and expectations of therapy Orientation for brief CBT involves a discussion of the focused and time-limited nature of the therapy, plus the provider\u2019s rationale for selecting brief CBT to treat a particular problem. As noted in Module 1, this rationale includes the strong research basis of brief CBT and the fact that it is an empirically supported treatment. Many patients have little, if any, exposure to psychotherapy other than examples in the popular media. Although media may be a good avenue for disseminating innovative treatment strategies and therapies, there is an abundance of misinformation that patients may be exposed to. Conveying the legitimate science of CBT in ways that your patients can understand may help build motivation for change during the therapeutic process as well as debunk previously misinformed perspectives. Providing patients with an understanding of the therapeutic process allows them to be more active and aware of their role in the progression of therapy. Knowledge of the process of brief CBT enhances the collaborative nature of therapy. When? (Indications/Contraindications) Discussing the rationale for CBT and describing the process of therapy should occur in the first session. However, it is useful to revisit the model throughout treatment to expand upon the rationale for CBT skills. The explanation of the model can be tailored to the patient's presenting problem, and examples to explain each component can be drawn from those generated in discussing problems specific to your patients (e.g., \"I can't seem to get out of bed, and then I feel worthless\"). For patients who think in concrete terms, it might be necessary to provide many examples and initially focus on behaviors rather than cognitions. 53 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 7 How? ",

For patients who think in concrete terms, it might be necessary to provide many examples and initially focus on behaviors rather than cognitions. 53 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 7 How? (Instructions/Handouts) INTRODUCING THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL MODEL The cognitive behavioral model is a theoretical paradigm for explaining associations among thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Most individuals believe that situations give rise to their emotions, as it may be easier to understand how intense emotional experiences occur in specific situations. However, the cognitive behavioral model suggests that thoughts we have about situations influence our behaviors and impact our emotions (Figure 7.1). This perspective does not negate the impact of external/internal stimuli (i.e., situations) on emotions, rather it facilitates a shift in perspective to facilitate the therapeutic process. For instance, individuals who are depressed or anxious tend to display patterns of unhelpful or \u201cinaccurate\u201d thinking. In the cognitive elements of CBT, the provider trains patients in specific skills that help them learn to improve their mood and change behavior by modifying the way they think about situations. Figure 7.1 Cognitive Behavioral Model  54 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 7 INITIAL SESSION To prepare for the initial session, thoroughly review all intake information and use modules in this manual. You need the intake information to  initially conceptualize and formulate a therapeutic plan. Using the patient\u2019s presenting problems, symptoms, current level of functioning, culture, and history helps in developing the therapeutic plan. From the intake information, it is imperative that you assess the patient\u2019s suicidality. This can be done by asking about the patient\u2019s suicidal ideation, intent, or plan and determining his or her level of hopelessness, as well as the reasons for hopelessness. If the patient\u2019s suicidality seems high, then crisis intervention is above all other therapeutic considerations. In the case of an acutely suicidal patient, seek supervision or consultation and follow approved clinic procedures for managing a suicidal patient (e.g., contact on-call psychiatrist for evaluation). Patient Expectations for Treatment You should inquire about what the patient knows about how therapy is conducted. Orienting your patient to therapy includes describing the cognitive-behavioral model and answering any questions he/she might have about the progression of therapy. Using the patient\u2019s examples to help explain the cognitive-behavioral model will assist him/her in being able to see how the model can work and how it has worked for other patients with similar problems. Patients may confuse psychotherapy (i.e.",

Using the patient\u2019s examples to help explain the cognitive-behavioral model will assist him/her in being able to see how the model can work and how it has worked for other patients with similar problems. Patients may confuse psychotherapy (i.e., typically uses Socratic dialogue, motivational enhancement strategies, and collaborative planning to foster patients\u2019 motivation for change to positively impact psychopathology) with counseling (i.e., advice is given and the focus may not be reducing the contribution of cognitive-behavioral components on patients\u2019 problems). Further, patients often think therapy is a place where they will come and be lectured and told what to do, or a place to vent without a focus on behavior change. It is essential in brief CBT that the patient understands that therapy is a partnership between the provider and the patient, in which they work together so that the patient can better understand feelings and solve problems. Negotiating the amount of time the patient will need to be in therapy is also important. For brief CBT, patients typically attend weekly individual sessions for four to eight weeks. However, the amount of time in therapy and the number of days a week can be reassessed periodically and adjusted to meet the needs of the patient (see Module 8 \u2013 Goal Setting). Discussing Symptoms and Diagnostic Issues with the Patient Most patients want to know how they have been diagnosed. Explain the disorder in terms of cognitive and behavioral symptoms to clarify how CBT will directly address their problems. Giving patients descriptions of common symptoms of their disorder can also be helpful. In-Session Example 7.1 Example: There are cognitive and behavioral aspects of feeling depressed. Cognitive characteristics of depression include having negative thoughts about yourself, such as \u201cI am no good,\u201d or \u201cThings are not going to get better.\u201d Behavioral characteristics are ways your body tells you you\u2019re depressed, such as changes in your appetite or sleep patterns. 55 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 7 Feedback The collaborative piece of CBT involves asking a patient for feedback on the session (e.g., \u201cWhat did you think about our session today? Did we leave out anything you think is important to discuss?\u201d) and on how the patient feels about the cognitive- behavioral model (e.g., \u201cDo you feel you have at least a basic understanding of the model, or should we be sure to review it in detail again next week?\u201d) at the end of the first and subsequent sessions.

Did we leave out anything you think is important to discuss?\u201d) and on how the patient feels about the cognitive- behavioral model (e.g., \u201cDo you feel you have at least a basic understanding of the model, or should we be sure to review it in detail again next week?\u201d) at the end of the first and subsequent sessions. Encouraging patients to offer feedback strengthens the rapport and trust within the therapeutic relationship and indicates to patients that they are active members of the therapeutic process. It shows that the provider cares about what patients think and feel and values their input. This is also a time to resolve misunderstandings about the cognitive model or things that occurred in the session (e.g., \u201cWas there anything that bothered you about the session, or anything that you\u2019d like to change?\u201d). Getting feedback from the patient shows how important it is to work as a team and helps you work on sharpening your abilities in therapy. It also allows you to attend to and repair any real or perceived therapeutic fissures or needed treatment modifications in a timely way.

Goal setting is the process of collaboratively identifying specific therapeutic outcomes for treatment. Goals must be observable, measurable and achievable and relate to cognitive or behavioral changes relevant to the patient\u2019s presenting problem. Goals are tied to specific skills to be addressed in treatment. Goals increase the continuity of sessions; allow directed, focused treatment; and enable the patient and provider to assess the progress of therapy and identify change in an objective manner. When? (Indications/Contraindications) In addition to identifying the problem and building rapport, goal setting is one of the first therapeutic activities to be completed in brief CBT. Although goals can be changed/ modified at any point during therapy, to maximize applicability and benefit to the patient, a preliminary set of goals should be established and agreed upon by the end of the first or second session. How? (Instructions/Handouts) Goal setting begins with the identification of broad goals. These are global and refer to areas of functioning (e.g., family, work, social relationships, financial concerns, health). Broad goals are closely tied to your case conceptualization and the patient\u2019s presenting problem. Once broad goals are identified collaboratively, you and the patient should prioritize goals. This process involves determining the most central issues that cause concern and arranging them from most important to least important. Starting with the problem that has the best chance of being solved and is central to the patient\u2019s presenting concerns can help increase the patient\u2019s commitment to therapy. If one skill is prerequisite to a subsequent goal, you can prioritize that goal in treatment (e.g., relaxation before exposure, awareness of thoughts before thought challenging). Use a graded approach to goals, in which you take small steps in service of the larger goal each week through session content or homework assignments. Identifying and sequencing action steps involve breaking each goal into smaller steps to help the patient know what to do at every stage of accomplishing the goal without feeling overwhelmed by a huge task.

Identifying and sequencing action steps involve breaking each goal into smaller steps to help the patient know what to do at every stage of accomplishing the goal without feeling overwhelmed by a huge task. It is important to note that all patient concerns may not be attended to in a brief treatment format. 58 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 8 Once goals have been identified and prioritized, they are operationalized, which involves defining the goal and all the steps that it will take to achieve it in concrete, observable/measurable cognitive or behavioral terms. Another important process of brief CBT is ongoing measurement-based care (MBC) used to assess the progression of the patient\u2019s symptoms throughout therapy. Use disorder- specific, validated self-report tools allowing patients to identify the degree specific symptoms contribute to their distress. This process informs baseline distress and end-of- treatment progress and identifies areas still requiring attention during therapy. You can administer self-report tools to patients during the first and last sessions and as frequently as each therapy session. Some gold-standard instruments are as follows: \u2022 Depression: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9, 9 items; PHQ-2, 2 items; Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2003) \u2022 Anxiety: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7, 7 items; GAD-2, 2 items; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Lowe, 2006) \u2022 Suicide: Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS; Posner et al., 2010) \u2022 PTSD: PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; Weathers, Litz, Keane, Palmieri, Marx, & Schnurr, 2013) \u2022 Alcohol Use: Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption (AUDIT-C; Bush, Kivlahan, McDonnell, Fihn, & Bradley, 1998) \u2022 Drug Use: Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10; Skinner, 1982) In-Session Example 8.1 Example Goal: Learn two cognitive and two behavioral strategies for coping with stress.  \u2022 Operational Cognitive Goal \u2022 Learn and use thought testing and problem solving to manage anxious thoughts/situations.  \u2022 Operational Behavioral Goal \u2022 Plan and complete one pleasant or social activity per week. ASSESSING FACILITATORS, BARRIERS, IMPORTANCE, AND CONFIDENCE Once a goal or multiple goals have been established, it is critical to assess the patient\u2019s situation and attitudes about the goals. For example, ask whether there are aspects of the patient\u2019s life that may facilitate or inhibit the goal. A strong family and social-support system may help a patient to reach a goal, but a functional limitation may create an obstacle. Explore facilitators and barriers and discuss strategies to maximize the chance of goal attainment. 59 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 8 Assessments of importance and confidence are also important.

Explore facilitators and barriers and discuss strategies to maximize the chance of goal attainment. 59 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 8 Assessments of importance and confidence are also important. Ask the patients to rate the importance of the goal on a scale of 0 to 100 (where 0 is not important and 100 is very important). Discuss ratings lower than 60 or so, and refine goals to increase meaning. Similarly, ask patients to rate their confidence in obtaining the goal. Here, confidence ratings could be a little lower but would, hopefully, increase as treatment progresses. TROUBLESHOOTING GOAL SETTING Some clues that goals may need modification are worsening symptoms, no change in symptoms, patient failure to complete homework (see Module 10: Homework), and patient/collateral report that the patient is not benefitting from treatment. In these cases, it is important to revisit initial goals with the patient and elicit feedback about the progress of therapy (e.g., \u201cWhat do you find helpful?\u201d). Often, too-ambitious goals need to be modified. In these cases, it is important to frame the revision in terms of taking small steps towards lasting change, normalize the difficulty of making changes when depressed or anxious, and join the patient (e.g., \u201cI think I may have gotten a little ahead of myself; let\u2019s modify these a little, so that they can be the most help for you\u201d; \u201cI may have missed the mark on this one; what do you think about adding/changing/removing a goal?\u201d). Goal revision should not imply to patients that they have failed in therapy. It is an opportunity to model functional change in response to changing situations. If a patient is worsening, discuss any changes in context (e.g., relationship, work, sleep, medication compliance, physical health) the patient is experiencing. Create a new goal pertinent to what the patient believes is worsening and what might help. At this point, you should also consult a supervisor/colleague or other professional (e.g., patient\u2019s treating physician). If patients are not improving, elicit their feedback about changes they are experiencing and their perceptions about why these changes have occurred. If a patient seems to have trouble understanding the assignments, focus on more concrete and behavioral skills.

In other words, it is usually not reasonable to try to do something every day; and setting a goal like this will result in failure if the patient misses just one day. Alternatively, discuss the goal with the patient; and start small. If patients succeed, they are more likely to remain actively engaged. \u2022 Example: How often do you think it is reasonable to do something pleasant?

Agenda setting is a collaborative process through which you and the patient decide how session time will be spent. You and the patient offer items you would like to discuss and then decide the order of items and the amount of time you will spend on each. Each item should serve a treatment goal (see Module 8: Goal Setting and Module 4: Cognitive Behavioral Case Conceptualization and Treatment Planning). Agenda setting ensures that session time is well spent and that both provider and patient have input into session content. When? (Indications/Contraindications) An agenda should be set within the first 10 minutes of every session. Without setting an agenda, it is very easy for vocal patients to \u201crun away\u201d with the session by recounting the events of the past week or describing the history of a problem. It is also easy for more passive patients to never indicate which items are most important to them. Collaboratively setting an agenda ensures that both your and the patient\u2019s needs are met. Setting a time limit for each item increases the chance all items can be covered. Encourage patients to think between sessions about what they would like to discuss in session. If patients do not offer an agenda item, you can introduce an item and check with patients to see if they feel it would be valuable to discuss. How? (Instructions/Handouts) It is your responsibility to model how to set agendas for the patient. In the first few sessions, you will be setting the agenda because often the patient is unsure of what is being asked or what to discuss in therapy. You can help patients become more comfortable with setting their own agenda by asking questions like, \u201cWhat is the main reason you came to therapy?\u201d or \u201cWhat is causing you the most trouble right now?\u201d or \u201cWhat are your most pressing issues today?\u201d or \u201cWhat are your thoughts about the focus of today\u2019s session?\u201d It is also important to assist the patient in prioritizing issues on the agenda to give an acceptable amount of attention to each. After listing and prioritizing items, allot an approximate time to each item for discussion.

As time passes, the responsibility of setting an agenda for the session should shift to patients. This will eventually help them to set agendas, prioritize problems, and suggest interventions for issues encountered after completing therapy. This level of increasing patient responsibility also translates into their overall functioning by increasing autonomy of functioning as they work toward ending treatment. Highlight 9.1 Typical Session Outline 1. Briefly review patient\u2019s mood and/or physical functioning (Five minutes). Elicit responses concerning the patient\u2019s mood, and consider any and all discrepancies (e.g., change in strength or nature of usual mood, change from last week or beginning of treatment). Ask the patient to complete a self-report tool to measure symptom intensity and frequency. Medically ill patients may benefit from regular assessments and updates on their physical health symptoms and functioning. Also ask the patient to offer explanations for mood improvement or decline. This brief update allows you to gauge how the patient is progressing and identify positive and negative change. If medication management or physician collaboration is part of the patient\u2019s treatment, this is also a good time to check on any side-effects the patient might be having from medication and make adjustments as needed. 2. Bridge discussion from previous session with the current session (Five minutes). In bridging sessions, you are checking the patient\u2019s understanding of what was discussed in the previous session. Reinforcing what the patient learned in past sessions is essential to the improvement that the patient makes outside the therapeutic relationship. Having the patient complete a Bridging Worksheet can assist in this stage of the agenda. Some issues discussed during this phase could become items on the agenda for the current session. 3. Set the agenda for the current session and prioritize the items (Five minutes). First ask patients what they would like to discuss, and then offer an item. If patients bring several agenda items, they might need to indicate which is the most important to discuss first. When patients offer a situation as an item (e.g.",

If patients bring several agenda items, they might need to indicate which is the most important to discuss first. When patients offer a situation as an item (e.g., fight with boyfriend followed by food binge), you can use the situation as part of their agenda item, that is, as part of the skill being taught. For example, you can use the above scenario to teach/review a thought record. 4. Review any homework given in the previous session (Five to ten minutes). Patients who do between-session homework improve more than those who do not. To reinforce and troubleshoot between-session learning, it is important to review homework. In-session review serves two purposes: it reinforces the importance of homework and allows you to assess skill acquisition. If you identify errors in homework, you can use additional session time to review the skill. Reviewing 64 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 9 homework can take a small amount of time; or it can take the entire session, depending on what patients have learned from doing it and what difficulties they have encountered in completing it. 5. Discuss agenda items and set up homework (20-25 minutes). Discuss agenda items, starting with the first and most important. If you are running short on time, inform the patient that you will discuss the other items at your next appointment. Set up homework that is directly connected to what has been discussed in the session. 6. Summarize the current session and exchange feedback (Five minutes). Two types of summarizing are recommended. The first is a brief summary that should be done after the conclusion of each section of the agenda to reinforce what has been discussed. The second type is used to clarify and remind patients of the thoughts they have presented and how those thoughts changed as a result of the exercise. It is important to use patients\u2019 specific words in summarizing their thoughts. At the end of the session, summarize the main points of the entire session. As the sessions progress, ask patients to do the summaries. Finally, exchange feedback about the session, skill, or progress of therapy.

TROUBLESHOOTING AGENDA SETTING In discussing agenda items, there are many pitfalls for a new CBT provider. It is your responsibility to keep the discussion on track and focused. To prevent unfocused discussion, gently guide patients back to the topic when they drift; emphasize key emotions, beliefs , and automatic thoughts; and often summarize and rephrase what patients say. You can also discuss at the start of therapy that one of your roles is to keep sessions on track; so, you may, at times, need to shift the focus of conversation. Getting patients\u2019 agreement on this point at the beginning helps them feel more comfortable if you need to redirect or interrupt later in therapy. Pacing is also a concern for providers, but prioritizing and collaboratively agreeing on agenda items and times can help you and the patient stay within the allotted time. When guiding the conversation with your patient, you can use a mix of close-ended or open-ended questions in response to time constraints. Patients and providers sometimes have difficulty setting the agenda together. Sometimes patients do not want to contribute to the agenda because of feeling hopeless or negative toward therapy. Occasionally, the patient may also be unfocused when setting the agenda (e.g., recount events of past week). It is often necessary to educate the patient about therapy by clarifying what kinds of issues constitute agenda issues and how session time may be optimally spent. 65 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 9 CBT suggests that change involves skill acquisition and not simply identifying distorted thinking. Therefore, recognizing an unhelpful thought can be enlightening, but you should also use session time to teach skills to address the problem (e.g., thought records, behavioral activation) and not simply discuss the issue with the patient or offer advice. The process of skill acquisition is what sets CBT apart from \u201ctalk therapies\u201d (supportive therapy). EXAMPLE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS 1. Create an agenda for next session, using the given outline. 2. Think about adjustments you would like to make to our current agenda and reasons why. 3.

Homework is an essential and effective component of brief CBT. Because of the condensed number of sessions in brief CBT, assignments such as readings, behavior monitoring, and practicing new skills should be given to the patient to practice and use outside sessions. Homework assignments facilitate patient skill acquisition, treatment compliance, and symptom reduction by integrating the concepts learned in sessions into daily life. Homework is a key mechanism for facilitating between-session work and progress. When? (Indications/Contraindications) Give homework assignments throughout treatment. The nature and frequency of assignments are left to your discretion. Consider patient characteristics when assigning homework, specifically, reading ability, cognitive functioning, cultural identity, level of distress, work/life balance, and motivation. During the beginning stage of therapy, suggest homework; but, as therapy progresses, encourage patients to generate their own between- session activities. This helps them to continue to use skills outside therapy and after the end of treatment. Some patients may be hesitant to participate in homework assignments, so it is your responsibility to be open to patient feedback about assignments, give reasons for each task, and personalize homework assignments for each patient. Also, patients may have a negative reaction to the word homework, which might prompt you to use practice or at-home exercises. How?

Also, patients may have a negative reaction to the word homework, which might prompt you to use practice or at-home exercises. How? (Instructions/Handouts) SEVEN TIPS FOR SETTING HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS 1. One Size Does Not Fit All. Always tailor assignments to patients. Their reading level; desire to change; cognitive functioning; and, even, stage of life determine how much and what type of homework assignment fits them best. For example, a single, working mother who is also a full-time student may not have time to read a complete book as a bibliotherapy assignment. Assigning her a small part of the book or an article may be more reasonable. Breaking assignments down into smaller parts is also useful. Always consider the patient\u2019s diagnosis and presenting problem when assigning homework and ask yourself: 68 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 10 In-Session Example 10.1 \u201cCan the patient handle this homework, and will it be beneficial to his/her growth?\u201d \u201cCould there be a negative result from this assignment; and, if so, is the patient prepared to handle it outside session?\u201d 2. Explain in Detail. Knowing the reason for an assignment and how it relates to overall treatment goals help patients understand why they are doing the assignment and also may encourage him/her to complete it. Most patients are interested in how certain activities may improve their situation or relieve their symptoms. Explain assignments in the context of treatment goals and the cognitive model to enhance patient buy-in to the tasks. 3. Set Homework as a Team. Involving patients in designing and scheduling homework increases the chances they will complete it. It is also important to get the patient\u2019s agreement to complete the homework. Suggest homework assignments, and then ask the patient if you can help make adjustments to it. Ask, for example, the following: In-Session Example 10.2 \u201cDo you think this is reasonable?\u201d \u201cWhat would you change about the assignment?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s do an example together first. Then we can make changes if we need to.\u201d 4. Create a Win-Win Situation. Do not scold a patient for not completing homework assignments, but also do not dismiss their value. If a patient does not finish homework, which is common, you may learn about the patient\u2019s level of motivation, ability to follow-through, or level of distress (e.g., too depressed to complete it). Failure to complete homework is an opportunity for you to evaluate the patient\u2019s reason for noncompliance. The patient may have been anxious about completing an assignment incorrectly or may question the utility of the assignment. These thoughts are helpful to discuss in session. ",

The patient may have been anxious about completing an assignment incorrectly or may question the utility of the assignment. These thoughts are helpful to discuss in session. 5. Start Homework In-Session. In the first few sessions after assigning homework, do a few examples with the patient in session, when possible. This gives the patient a clearer picture of what is expected and allows questions that he/she might have about the homework. It also gives the patient an idea how long the homework will take. In subsequent sessions, the patient may start the assignment with your assistance to troubleshoot questions about it. 69 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 10 6. Ask About and Review Homework. To emphasize the importance of homework, always ask about and review homework the session after you assign it. If the patient did not complete homework, use session time, if possible, to complete the assignment, which may also help identify the aspects of the skill that need to be reviewed. If you do not review homework in session, patients may stop completing it. 7. Anticipate and Prepare for Problems. With the first few homework assignments, help problem solve the assignment by eliciting feedback about it and planning when and how it will be completed. Assignments can be scheduled for a particular day and time to overcome barriers, and foreseeable problems for completing the assignment at that time can be discussed. For example, if the patient\u2019s behavioral activation is to walk for 15 minutes on Wednesday at 4pm, discuss what to do if it rains or other factors prevent completion. Agree upon and schedule a second option (e.g., using treadmill for 15 minutes). USING SELF-HELP RESOURCES AS HOMEWORK Assigning the patient reading materials relevant to brief CBT presenting problems is a useful tool for brief CBT because it allows patients to read about their disorder or CBT between sessions. This emphasizes the self-management focus of CBT and can accelerate therapeutic progress and maintenance of changes. Reading materials may be websites, book chapters, or sections of CBT patient manuals. Some common examples of CBT bibliotherapy are Mind Over Mood (Greenberger & Padesky, 2016) and Feeling Good Handbook (Burns, 1999). HOMEWORK TROUBLESHOOTING Practical Problems Occasionally, providers may encounter a patient who waits until the day before a session to do the homework. This is problematic because certain assignments, such as monitoring automatic thoughts, are most effective and most accurate when completed in the moment. ",

This is problematic because certain assignments, such as monitoring automatic thoughts, are most effective and most accurate when completed in the moment. There are many reasons patients may put off doing homework; and your role is to explore these reasons in a proactive, nonjudgmental, nonpunitive way. Sometimes patients may simply forget to do homework. They may have a busy schedule or have trouble remembering to complete homework. Using a calendar and scheduling time to do homework are useful in this situation and provide the opportunity for time-management skill building. You can also work with the patient to download self- management apps on his/her smartphone or tablets. A few assignments described in this text might be difficult for some patients. If a patient is having trouble completing an assignment because of the level of difficulty, it is your job to explain how to complete it and gauge the patient\u2019s understanding. Some assignments may need to be broken down into smaller steps until the patient can fully grasp how it is to be completed. 70 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 10 Psychological Problems Patients who don\u2019t complete homework might have unhelpful thoughts about themselves, the homework assignment, or therapy that need to be addressed. In these cases encouragement, thought testing, and listing the advantages and disadvantages of doing homework may be useful. Though outside the scope of this manual, techniques, such as motivational interviewing (Rollnick, et al., 1999), may also be used to address the ambivalence a patient may feel about homework. Patient perceptions of importance and confidence are very important for noncompliance issues. Many patients have negative reactions to the word homework. They may feel overwhelmed by the perceived time or energy it will take to complete or concerned that therapy is like schoolwork. In giving homework, address any concerns the patient may have about time constraints; and explain how long each assignment should take, while working with the patient to generate reasonable tasks. If the patient dislikes the term homework, work with them collaboratively to select another label, such as practice, between-session progress, task, or experiment. ",

Provider Homework Bias Although completion of homework is primarily the patient\u2019s responsibility, sometimes your thoughts about an assignment or approach to homework play a role in noncompliance. Check your own thoughts about assigning homework, and determine whether there is anything you can adjust in your approach that could better encourage the patient. Ask yourself, \u201cIs the assignment too difficult?,\u201d \u201cDid I explain the assignment thoroughly?,\u201d or \u201cHave I led the patient to believe that homework is unimportant to therapy?\u201d SAMPLE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS Examples of homework that could be assigned for each cognitive and behavioral skill are included in each module.

The cognitive-behavioral model suggests that three layers of unhelpful thinking exist in individuals struggling with psychosocial difficulties: automatic thoughts, intermediate beliefs, and core beliefs (depicted below in Figure 11.1). Figure 11.1 Layers of Unhelpful Thinking  72 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 11 Automatic thoughts are immediate internal reactions that occur in response to situations and/or events. We are often unaware of automatic thoughts because of their almost instantaneous nature. Sometimes automatic thoughts are helpful, as they help us navigate our environments. However, automatic thoughts become unhelpful when they are attached to symptoms of psychopathology (e.g., social isolation, depression, anxiety, etc.) and negatively impact people's quality of life. One way that we gain insight about these automatic thoughts is by understanding our emotional reactions to them. Unhelpful thinking styles are distorted reflections of situations that are often accepted as true. In essence, these unhelpful thought styles are real-time manifestations of negative beliefs (i.e., about oneself, the world, and the future) that are triggered by situations or exaggerated by psychiatric symptoms (e.g., anxiety or depression). Intermediate beliefs are attitudes or rules that a person follows in life that typically apply across situations (not situation specific as with automatic thoughts). Intermediate beliefs can often be stated as conditional rules: \u201cIf x, then y.\u201d For example, \u201cIf I am thin, then I will be loved by others.\u201d Individuals create these assumptions by categorizing the information they receive from the world around them. These rules guide thoughts and subsequently influence behaviors. Core beliefs drive rules and automatic thoughts. For example, the belief, \u201cI am unlovable,\u201d may be driving the conditional rule, If I am thin, then I will be loved by others, which may drive obsessive thinking about one\u2019s appearance, excessive exercise, or disordered eating habits. Core beliefs are often formed in childhood and solidified over time as a result of one\u2019s perceptions of experiences. Because individuals with psychological disorders tend to store information consistent with negative beliefs but ignore evidence that contradicts them, core beliefs tend to be rigid and pervasive. Although automatic thoughts are often tied to a specific situational trigger, intermediate and core beliefs are more global and cut across domains. Individuals tend to have core beliefs that involve either interpersonal (\u201cI\u2019m unlovable\u201d) or achievement issues (\u201cI\u2019m incompetent\u201d). When? (Indications/Contraindications) Identifying unhelpful automatic thoughts is the first step in the cognitive component of therapy. The focus of intervention in brief CBT is the unhelpful automatic thought.

Because of the interrelated nature of thoughts and beliefs, an intervention targeting automatic thoughts may also change underlying beliefs (depicted below). ",

Therefore, brief CBT can result in belief modification, even if the target of treatment was automatic thoughts. 73 Figure 11.2 Brief CBT and Unhelpful Thinking  Because patients progress through treatment at different rates, you may be able to identify and challenge some beliefs late in brief therapy (sessions 5-8) for some patients. For other patients, work will be limited to automatic thoughts. Highlight 11.1 Because skill building to alleviate symptoms and prevent relapse is a central focus of CBT, mastery of skills is paramount. Focus on building a skill set with patients that they can generalize to different situations, thoughts, or beliefs. It is less important to identify and modify deep-seated childhood beliefs. For most patients in brief CBT, this will not be necessary for symptom reduction. However, some patients may benefit from this work. Although you may not discuss beliefs directly with patients, as part of the case conceptualization, they should constantly be forming hypotheses about what beliefs may be driving the thoughts (see Module 4: Case Conceptualization and Treatment Planning). In identifying thoughts and beliefs, ask yourself several questions. \u2022 Is the thought/belief secondary to another thought/belief? \u2022 How much does the patient believe it? \u2022 Does it affect the patient\u2019s life negatively? ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 11  74 \u2022 Is the patient prepared to work on it now, or should they tackle the belief later?

(Instructions/Handouts) EXPLAINING AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS TO YOUR PATIENT It is important for patients to understand he rationale for identifying automatic thoughts before gaining skills to address their own thoughts. Using the situation-->thought--> feeling triangle introduced in Module 7 (Orienting the Patient to Brief CBT) can be helpful in explaining automatic thoughts. Completing the triangle with the patients\u2019 recent or current automatic thoughts can facilitate their understanding. In-Session Example 11.1 Provider: \u201cSo, Pamela, how have you been feeling this week?\u201d Patient: \u201cJust really sad\u2026as usual. It seems like I\u2019m always feeling that way.\u201d Provider: \u201cDid anything in particular trigger this sad feeling this weekend?\u201d Patient: \u201cYes, I had to go to my cousin\u2019s wedding; and it was really difficult because I  started thinking about how I will never get married.\u201d Provider: \u201cPamela, that\u2019s what we call an automatic thought.

AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS IN SESSION Be aware of patients\u2019 hot thoughts during sessions. Hot thoughts are automatic thoughts that occur in combination with a change in emotion or mood. Hot thoughts are particularly poignant or strong thoughts that are often associated with unhelpful core beliefs and should be targeted in therapy. Hot thoughts and the accompanying situation and emotion are tracked on the first three columns of the thought record (see p. 81). To identify which automatic thoughts are \u201chot,\u201d listen for verbal cues, such as the language used in the thought (see Cognitive Distortion worksheet, p. 83), and watches nonverbal cues, such as increased volume of speech or fidgeting. Changes in facial expression, shifts in position, or hand movements can be helpful in determining whether a patient is experiencing an automatic hot thought. Listening to tone, pitch, volume, and the pace of a patient\u2019s speech is also beneficial. ",

In these instances, you are simply an observer of the behavior and make a note of your observation to the patient (\u201cYou are speaking more loudly; what is going through your mind right now?\u201d). The patient then provides an explanation of the behavior. In-Session Example 11.3 Patient \u201cMy boss reprimanded me again yesterday\u201d (sighs heavily.) Provider: \u201cTell me more.\u201d Patient: \u201cWell, we were at a meeting; and I had just made my presentation, and he  said he had expected a better product for the client.\u201d (voice gets softer,  beings wringing hands). Provider: \u201cYour voice changed a little when you said that; tell me what is going  through your mind right now?\u201d Example continued: Patient: \u201cI just feel like a failure at everything. My work has always been the one thing  I was good at, and now I am failing at that, too.\u201d Provider: \u201cLet\u2019s take a look at that line of thinking and the feelings it creates. It  seems that when that thought entered your mind, your mood changed very  quickly. Did you notice that?\u201d Patient: \u201cYeah, I guess it did upset me pretty fast.\u201d You usually will also need to use specific questions to elicit an automatic hot thought. These questions are found in Module 12. AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS BETWEEN SESSIONS In brief CBT, a principal characteristic is the work the patient does outside of session. Because identifying automatic thoughts is a novel concept to many, practicing outside of session will facilitate movement and change in therapy. In fact, Burns and Nolen-Hoeksema (1992) found that patients who completed homework had significantly better treatment outcomes than those who did not. Practicing key skills between sessions allows session time to be used for new skill acquisition and troubleshooting. Initially, when a specific situation is brought up in session, always ask, \u201cWhat was going through your mind at that moment?\u201d This helps the patient build awareness of an automatic thought, both within and outside of session.

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 11 77 Because automatic thoughts may occur outside awareness, asking for a more detailed description of the situation is also helpful in pinpointing unhelpful thinking. For example, you could \"take the patient back\" to when it happened, using imagery (e.g., Where were you when this happened? What time of day was it?). If the patient reverts to past tense, remind them to tell the story in present tense to help bring back the thoughts and feelings that occurred in this situation. With continued questioning, it is possible that there may be more than one automatic thought associated with a problematic situation. Elicit and record all automatic thoughts given for a particular situation. In-Session Example 11.4 Provider: \u201cCraig, what else were you thinking during this phone call with your wife?\u201d Craig: \u201cI was thinking that she knows how bad I feel for not coming to the party  and she wants me to feel even worse.\u201d Provider: \u201cSo you weren\u2019t thinking only that they were using you. You were also  thinking that they knew you felt bad, and they wanted you to feel worse?\u201d Craig: \u201cYes.\u201d Provider: \u201cSo, that is really three different thoughts that you were having that were  creating feelings of anger?\u201d Craig: \u201cI guess so.\u201d Remember that a patient\u2019s automatic thoughts should be the actual words or images that go through their mind. Patients (or providers) may often interpret or rephrase thoughts; however, the goal is to get unprocessed thoughts verbatim. DECIDING WHICH AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS TO FOCUS ON Once patients become aware of how many automatic thoughts they have, they may feel overwhelmed by their sheer number. Uncovering one thought may lead to another and so on. Therefore, it is important to focus on the most important automatic thoughts and the hot thoughts that are likely to bring about the greatest change. There are several things patients can do once they have identified an automatic thought. They can decide to focus on that thought, choose another thought associated with the situation, or move on to another topic if they feel that there is a more powerful thought that they would like to tackle.

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 11 78 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 11 You can help the patient choose automatic thoughts to focus on by frequently checking: \u2022 Goals for this session \u2022 Patient\u2019s agenda items and addressing those problems \u2022 The importance of the thought chosen in reaching therapeutic goals Another technique is to identify a few automatic thoughts and then rate them on a scale of 0-100, based on how intense the associated feeling is (rate the feeling from 0-100), and how much patient believes the thought (rate believability from 0-100). This helps to quantify which automatic thoughts are most important. The thoughts with the strongest ratings should be considered first. Unhelpful automatic thoughts often fall into certain categories. These are common \"cognitive distortions\" or thinking errors. Identifying patterns of cognitive distortions in the patient's thought records or speech is instrumental for choosing a hot thought, conceptualizing the case, and planning treatment. A patient often has one or two common patterns of unhelpful thinking. Identifying these patterns helps him/her identify them when they come up and provides you an opportunity to intervene on a thought triggered in multiple situations. Therefore, changing a particular thought that is part of an unhelpful thinking pattern (e.g., tendency to ignore the positive) may have multiple benefits for the patient. For a list of common thinking errors, see the Unhelpful Thinking Styles at the end of this module. INTERMEDIATE BELIEFS To identify an intermediate belief, you must first know how to recognize patients\u2019 automatic thoughts. You can do this by identifying an automatic thought and then attempting to identify an attitude or assumption patients feel about themselves, the future, others, or the world. These assumptions can be identified by listening for themes in the patient\u2019s thoughts and behavior. You can use several techniques to identify an intermediate belief: \u2022 Look for an intermediate belief that comes in the form of a patient\u2019s automatic thought. \u2022 Provide the first part of an assumption (\u201cIf x...\u201d), and enlist the help of the patient to complete it. \u2022 Elicit a rule or an attitude from the patient and change it into an assumption. \u2022 Look for themes in the patient\u2019s automatic thoughts. Either come up with a hypothesis or ask the patient to identify a theme. ",

These hypotheses aid development of the case conceptualization and treatment plan (see Module 4). A belief that is likely to be core will appear in several different areas of the patient\u2019s life (i.e., relationships, work, parenting). If time permits in Brief CBT, after you have collected enough evidence to support the alleged core belief, present and discuss it with the patient. In-Session Example 11.5 \u201cI\u2019ve heard you say several times that you either didn\u2019t do a good job, or that someone else put in more time and energy. It seems to me that you feel inadequate a lot of the time. Is that right?\u201d At this point, you can elicit earlier life experiences consistent with the belief. This helps identify the possible origin of the belief and helps you explain it to the patient. In educating the patient about core beliefs, make several things clear: \u2022 Core beliefs are only ideas. Feeling them strongly does not make them true. \u2022 These beliefs started developing during childhood and are formed over time. Patients believe them today because they have stored evidence to support them and rejected evidence to contradict them. \u2022 These beliefs can be tested and changed through use of the techniques that will be taught in therapy. 80 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 11 EXAMPLE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS 1.

Generating counter-statements based on the data patients bring to session increases the believability of the thoughts/beliefs and, thus, the effectiveness of the counter thoughts/beliefs. When? (Indications/Contraindications) Typically, unhelpful automatic thoughts are the first targets in the cognitive component of CBT. Following the introduction of the cognitive model (see Module 7: Orienting Patient to Brief CBT), and skills for identifying automatic hot thoughts and their accompanying emotions (see Module 11: Identifying Unhelpful Thoughts), introduce techniques for challenging hot thoughts. These techniques should immediately follow the session on identifying hot thoughts, to build continuity and familiarity with the skill set and instill hope of change after identifying problematic thinking patterns. Although intermediate and core beliefs will be challenged in advanced stages of therapy, the techniques are similar for challenging thoughts. Many techniques below can be used interchangeably for challenging thoughts or beliefs. Brief CBT session time is best used for modifying thoughts or beliefs that are tightly held and strongly believed. How? (Instructions/Handouts) Socratic questioning is a provider stance for questioning unhelpful thinking. This process involves asking a series of open-ended, brief questions that guide patients to discover their idiosyncratic thoughts, feelings, or behaviors associated with a particular situation. Socratic questioning is nonjudgmental but is based on the provider\u2019s insight that the original premise of a thought or belief may be untrue; therefore, the questions are designed to expose the unhelpful thought or belief so that it may be challenged. The Thought Record is the staple of cognitive work in brief CBT. The first three columns (see Thought Record handout at the end of Module 11) are used for identifying troubling situations and the accompanying emotions and unhelpful thoughts. These three columns are used in conjunction with Module 10 in that when the situation-->thought--> feeling triangle is unfolded, it forms the first three columns of a Thought Record. 85 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 12 A seven-column Thought Record is used to challenge unhelpful thoughts and beliefs. Instructions for completing columns 4-7 are described in detail below. Once a hot thought and its accompanying emotion have been identified and rated, the hot thought is questioned to generate evidence for and against it. Building evidence may be introduced in the following way: In-Session Example 12.1 Example: We have identified a thought that is very powerful for you. You rated this thought as 90 out of 100 for sadness. ",

Building evidence may be introduced in the following way: In-Session Example 12.1 Example: We have identified a thought that is very powerful for you. You rated this thought as 90 out of 100 for sadness. Before spending a lot of time and energy on this thought, I want to know whether or not it is true. Often when people are depressed or anxious, they take thoughts like this at face value, without first asking whether they are true. Accepting thoughts like this as true would certainly lead to the symptoms you\u2019ve been struggling with. If I thought, \u201cI am worthless and can\u2019t do anything right,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t want to get out of bed in the morning either, and I would probably feel pretty hopeless and sad. When we test a thought like this, we are going to generate evidence for and against the thought. It is as though the thought were on trial, and you were a lawyer for the case. Remember, you have to be able to prove the evidence you are generating. So, now let\u2019s see how your thought stands up.... DEVELOPING BALANCED THINKING These instructions might be useful to help patients develop balanced thinking: 1. Help the patient question automatic thoughts by asking: \u2022 What evidence is there that this thought is true? \u2022 What evidence is there that this thought is not true? \u2022 What would I tell someone I loved who was in this situation and had these thoughts? \u2022 If my automatic thought is true, what is the worst that could happen? \u2022 If my automatic thought is true, what is the best thing that could happen? 2. Once you and the patient have generated evidence, combine it to form a more balanced thought. This thought will likely be much longer and more nuanced than the original hot thought. In-Session Example 12.2 Example: Taking all this information (from columns 4-5) into consideration, what is a more balanced thought that more accurately reflects the facts? 86 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 12 You might want to ask the following questions: \u2022 Taking the information into account, is there an alternative way of thinking about the situation? \u2022 Can someone I trust understand this situation in a different way? 3. Rate the believability of the alternative thought between 0-100%. If the thought is not more than 50% believable, more work is needed to identify an alternative thought. Go back to the evidence and keep working. ",

Rate the believability of the alternative thought between 0-100%. If the thought is not more than 50% believable, more work is needed to identify an alternative thought. Go back to the evidence and keep working. After the patient has generated an alternative thought, they should rate how much they believe the thought from 0-100% (0% = no belief at all, 100% = greatest belief). If the alternative thought is not rated at more than 50%, this may indicate that the patient has actually provided a more deeply rooted belief (as opposed to an automatic thought) as the initial automatic thought. It is important to recognize the difference between beliefs and automatic thoughts because patients have to be motivated to change their thinking during the cognitive restructuring process. This motivation to change is less likely to happen if patients don\u2019t believe in the change that they are trying to make. 4. Once a believable alternative thought is generated, re-rate the mood associated with the hot thought (0-100%) after reading the new thought. Reducing a thought/belief to a rating of 0% is not a realistic goal. Instead, a reduction of 30-50% often provides relief. Often patients will generate new emotions from the alternative thought. However, it is most important first to re-rate the old mood before generating new emotions. The same strategy of generating an alternative thought for an unhelpful thought is used when challenging a core belief. Once the belief is identified, the evidence is weighed, and a new more balanced belief is generated. Highlight 12.1 Summary: Completing Thought Records \u2022 \u2022 Identify situation and corresponding thoughts and feelings. \u2022 \u2022 Identify unhelpful thinking styles in thoughts (e.g., all or none thinking). \u2022 \u2022 Use Socratic questioning to identify hot thought. \u2022 \u2022 Elicit and rate emotions associated with hot thought. \u2022 \u2022 Rate believability of hot thought. \u2022 \u2022 Generate evidence for and against hot thought. \u2022 \u2022 Generate alternative thought from evidence. \u2022 \u2022 Rate believability of alternative thought. \u2022 \u2022 Re-rate emotion of hot thought that is elicited by alternative thought. 87 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 12 TROUBLESHOOTING THOUGHT/BELIEF MODIFICATION Some patients can see the benefits of doing a Thought Record immediately, but others might need to be motivated to be engaged.

If a thought record is assigned for homework, it must always be reviewed during the subsequent session. Taking session time to review the thought record emphasizes its importance to the patient. Introducing the Thought Record as an \u201cexperiment\u201d helps alleviate any performance anxiety the patient may have about completing it and may generate interest (\u201cGive the thought record a try this week, and we\u2019ll see how it works for you. Let me know next session how the experience to complete it was. That will help us decide whether or not this is a useful tool for you.\u201d) Occasionally, a patient will show disinterest in doing the Thought Record or get tired of it after a while. For instances like this, there are other ways you can suggest that the patient can continue to attempt the Thought Record: \u2022 If a patient complains of never having time to do a Thought Record when certain situations occur, suggest that they carry a blank Thought Record in a wallet or purse. \u2022 Patients can use their cell phone to record Thought Records or voice/audio record their thoughts. \u2022 If a patient has done the Thought Record for a while and is becoming disinterested, suggest doing a \u201cmental\u201d Thought Record, since they are familiar with the process. \u2022 Suggest reading old Thought Record that have similar situations and automatic thoughts of their own. \u2022 The patient can verbally dictate a Thought Record to someone and have that person write it down. \u2022 Instruct the patient to incorporate completion of the Thought Record into their daily routine, either at the same time of day or in an easily accessible location. There will not always be an immediate change to a patient\u2019s mood after a Thought Record is completed. It might be necessary to assess why there is no change. It could be attributed to the patient\u2019s deeply rooted belief in the automatic thought, to an unchanged underlying core belief, or to additional automatic thoughts that have not been evaluated. It is necessary to ask: Why was there no mood change after completion of the Thought Record? These other questions will also be helpful: \u2022 Have I described the situation in enough detail? \u2022 Did I identify and rate the right moods? \u2022 Is the thought I am testing an automatic thought? \u2022 Do I believe an unhelpful core belief is driving this thought? \u2022 Did I list multiple thoughts?

What other alternative thoughts are available? If thought/belief testing is ineffective in reducing negative mood, you can also explore the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining a thought/belief. As we know, there are many disadvantages to negative beliefs we have, but there are also advantages. The patient\u2019s perceptions of the advantages may be obstructing the change process. Understanding the function of the thought/belief for the patient may be useful in clarifying why certain thoughts/beliefs are resistant to modification. The provider should evaluate both the advantages and disadvantages of a patient\u2019s assumptions and beliefs but, in doing so, work to diminish the advantages and highlight the disadvantages. Often, when working to modify thoughts and beliefs, the patient may find evidence that supports the negative belief instead of evidence that contradicts it. If there is a good amount of evidence to support that negative core belief, then problem solving, rather than thought testing, is an appropriate strategy (see Module 15). Highlight 12.2 Seven Tips for Effective Thought Records 1. You must have mastered the use of Thought Records before introducing it to patients. 2. Reinforce and make sure that the patient believes in the cognitive model being used. 3. Teach the Thought Record in two sections: (1) The first three columns; Situation, Automatic thought(s), and Emotion(s), and (2) the last four columns; Evidence for and against thought, Alternative response, and New rating of emotion. 4. Use the patient\u2019s exact words when recording thoughts and feelings. Working with thoughts verbatim preserves the emotions or personal meaning for each thought. 5. The patient should be able to adequately complete the first three columns of the Thought Record before learning about the last four columns. 6. Completing a Thought Record is a skill and, like other brief CBT skills, requires practice. Success depends on the patient\u2019s understanding of the steps. Encourage the patient to take time with the skill and work through any frustration. 7. If the patient is not collaborative in completing the Thought Record in session or does not complete Thought Record homework, it is possible that they might have automatic thoughts about this type of exercise.

If the patient is not collaborative in completing the Thought Record in session or does not complete Thought Record homework, it is possible that they might have automatic thoughts about this type of exercise. Ask the patient to create a Thought Record of the Thought Record experience 89 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 12 EXAMPLE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS 1.

Behaviors represent the \u201cB\u201d in CBT interventions, and it is important that patients become aware of the connection between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors (see Figure 13.1 below). Patients may not be as aware of the impact that thoughts and emotions may have on their behaviors. For instance, helpful thoughts (e.g., \u201cToday is going to be a great day\u201d) may be related to more positive emotions (e.g., happiness, excitement, etc.) and subsequent behavioral engagement (e.g., socializing with others, completing meaningful activities, etc.). On the other hand, unhelpful thinking (e.g., \u201cMy life will never get better\u201d) may be linked to negative emotions (e.g., sadness, anxiety, frustration) and avoidant behavioral coping (e.g., social isolation, not going to work or attending school, not attending important family events). Thoughts, emotions, and behaviors may influence each other at any given moment throughout the day, and this relationship is bidirectional. Figure 13.1 Thoughts, Emotions, and Behaviors  Helping patients understand the connection between what they do (behavior), what they think, and how they feel can help them gain insight, increase motivation for change in therapy, and improve therapy outcomes. Just as it is important to understand how past experiences have impacted patients\u2019 problems, it is equally as important to focus on things patients can do now to change their emotional experiences as they move forward in life. However, it may be more difficult to influence behavioral change if patients are not aware of the connections between these three components of the cognitive-behavioral treatment model.  92 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 13 What Is Behavioral Activation, and Why Is It Important? Behavioral activation includes a set of procedures and techniques aimed at increasing patient activity and access to reinforcing situations that improve mood and functioning. From this behavioral standpoint, depression, for example, contains a host of characteristics that function to maintain depressive affect (e.g.",

Behavioral activation includes a set of procedures and techniques aimed at increasing patient activity and access to reinforcing situations that improve mood and functioning. From this behavioral standpoint, depression, for example, contains a host of characteristics that function to maintain depressive affect (e.g., passivity, fatigue, feelings of hopelessness) and decrease the chance of adaptive coping by increasing avoidance. The key here is that difficulty with mood often serves to increase avoidance of adaptive coping, including pleasant events, which help to alleviate and avoid depression. Re- introducing pleasant events (one form of behavioral activation) can serve to improve mood in many different ways - 1) reversing avoidance, 2) increasing physical activity, 3) increasing self-confidence and 4) increasing feelings of usefulness and purpose. An important point for providers: Behavioral activation (alternatively referred to as increasing pleasant activities) consists of a host of possible behaviors including, but not limited to: 1. Reintroducing prior pleasant activities 2. Introducing new pleasant activities 3. Active coping or mastery activities (e.g., taking some form of behavioral action) to alleviate or reduce a life stressor; examples of active/behavioral coping that are not pleasant-event driven include  \u0086 Filing or getting taxes done  \u0086 Cleaning out a messy closet  \u0086 Calling an estranged family member The goal of active coping is to decrease stress through accomplishment or overcoming avoidance. When? (Indications/Contraindications) Because of its relatively simple and straightforward approach, behavioral activation is a good technique for initial stages of treatment and can be highly effective for patients with limited insight into their difficulties. Activation is also easily measured (e.g., number, frequency, or duration of activities) and, therefore, can be used to document and convey progress to patients (e.g., to increase treatment investment and improve patient self- confidence and influence over symptoms). Behavioral interventions are particularly powerful for depressed mood. Activation for depression generally serves to get the patient moving. Integrating pleasant activities can be effective in improving depressed mood. However, getting the patient to complete activities is key. Almost all behaviors that include physical activity, planning, or accomplishing tasks are appropriate here. 93 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 13 How?

(Instructions/Handouts) STEP #1: PROVIDE PATIENT WITH RATIONALE FOR BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION. It is important to educate the patient as to what behavioral activation is and how it can be useful for improving depression and anxiety. Let patients know that feeling a little down or having a bad day and not feeling well physically can make it more likely that they will stop doing many activities that used to be pleasurable. When this happens, patients can get into the habit of avoiding pleasant activities that might actually help them feel better. It is also important for patients to understand the connection between what they do and how they feel, both mentally and physically. You are encouraged to explain to patients that increasing activity and/or taking action, even when we do not feel like it, help us to feel better physically, as well as decrease depression. Provider: I would like to talk a little about what your day looked like yesterday. Walk  me through your day (e.g., what did you do in the morning, afternoon,  evening) Patient: Well, in the morning I woke up at 10 am and ate breakfast. I watched TV until  noon. Then I ate lunch. Around 2:30 I took a shower. At 3:00 I went for a  walk with my dog. Provider: Okay, thanks. How did you feel in the morning? Patient: Tired. I just couldn\u2019t get motivated and did not want to do anything. I guess I  was feeling sorry for myself \u2013 depressed, I guess. Provider: You say you were feeling depressed. If you had to rate that feeling on a  scale of 0 to 100 (100 is worst depression) what would you say your  depression was? Patient: 65. Provider: What about in the afternoon after your shower and walk? How would you  rate your depression? Patient: 20. Provider: To what do you attribute this change in your depression? Patient: I guess I just got off my couch and started moving, which helped me feel  better. Provider: That would be my guess as well. (Subsequently, explain the connections  between mood and behavior and encourage use of behavioral activation). 94 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 13 The figure below visually describes the connection between mood and behavior and can be an effective aid in communicating with patients.

Figure 13.3 Improved Mood and Behavior  95 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 13 STEP #2: IDENTIFY BEHAVIORS \u2013 DISCUSS ACTIVITIES. Identification of potential activities begins by exploring with the patient activities that would be most meaningful. This may begin by having a general discussion about values that are important to the patient as well as goals that they may want to accomplish. Values clarification (i.e., identifying the most important things to patients) can help patients feel heard and convey the collaborative process of the therapeutic relationship. Explicitly identifying values may enhance a patient\u2019s motivation to change and guide the identification of behaviors that the patient would be willing to engage in related to his/her values. Additionally, a patient\u2019s values can help identify therapeutic goals to incorporate into the treatment plan. Exploring targets for behavioral activation may begin with asking patients about 1) the types of things they would like to do but have not been able to do, or 2) activities they already do but would like to do more often. It may be important to anchor these behaviors within the context of values or goals that are important to them. You might want to ask if there is something that they need to do that they have been unable to do or have been avoiding. Although you want patients to do activities that are purely pleasurable to elicit positive mood, some patients may want to accomplish something rather than focus on doing something pleasant. Possible questions might include: \u2022 \u201cCan you think of any activities or hobbies that you used to enjoy doing but have now stopped doing?\u201d \u2022 \u201cCan you think of any activities or hobbies that you would like to do but have never done? \u2022 \u201cAre there things in your life that you would like to change? If so, what would you like to do about these issues that you have previously not done?\u201d For patients who have difficulty identifying activities, you can introduce a behavioral activity checklist (see Appendix). Before completing the next steps (e.g., setting a plan), it is important to discuss the potential importance of the behavior with the patient. ",

Before completing the next steps (e.g., setting a plan), it is important to discuss the potential importance of the behavior with the patient. If he/she reports low importance, encourage the patient to find another, more meaningful activity. STEP #3: SET AN ACTION PLAN. Once the patient has identified a meaningful activity to engage in, help shape this work into a meaningful therapeutic goal. Action plans are one mechanism for creating meaningful behavioral goals for therapy. Action plans in their most basic form stipulate the specific goal to be accomplished, defined in terms of observable and measurable characteristics and a timeframe for monitoring progress. 96 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 13 In-Session Example 13.1 Example: Goal: To read at least three times per week (a minimum of 30 minutes per reading session) Timeframe: Patient will complete three reading sessions over the next week. An expanded action plan might also include: a. Additional details of the plan \u2013 e.g., how the goal will be obtained b. Possible barriers to reaching the goal and ways to address barriers if they arise c. Possible facilitators of obtaining the goal, e.g., important people or situations that might aid the patient d. Patient\u2019s confidence in reaching the goal in the timeline established; if confidence is low, you might wish to alter the plan to increase chances of success. e. Skills that the patient might want to enlist to help reach the goal (e.g., relaxation skills, problem-solving skills, etc.) STEP #4: MONITOR PROGRESS IN MOOD, MASTERY, AND CONFIDENCE. It is important to monitor the patient\u2019s mood and feelings of mastery and confidence. Outcomes such as improvement in mood, mastery, or confidence can be best identified through homework assignments that ask the patient to document the frequency and use of the behavioral activity and any corresponding emotions or feelings of mastery or confidence. On the basis of this monitoring of outcomes, evaluate the action plan and the patient\u2019s ability to work towards achieving goals. If problems arise, make changes accordingly (e.g., breaking down goals into smaller steps, determining patient perceptions of importance and changing goals accordingly). Monitoring shows the patient that you continue to believe in the importance of the technique/exercise and also serves to further motivate many patients by increasing the effectiveness of the intervention.

TIPS FOR MANAGING BARRIERS TO DOING ACTIVITIES 1. Help the patient break down more difficult activities into smaller steps. Look for alternative behaviors to accomplish a goal prohibited by a chronic illness, environmental stressors, or depressed mood. For example, a structural/mechanical engineer who was forced to retire because of a physical limitation may feel that life is no longer productive. Although the patient is physically unable to fulfill prior job duties, you can work with them to identify meaningful activities related to the prior occupation. In this case, the patient might benefit from volunteering at a university; providing consultation (e.g., over email or telephone calls); or volunteering for a local school, youth or church organization (e.g., talking about engineering). 97 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 13 2. It is also helpful and supportive to look for ways to help with behavioral activation. Family or other social networks that the patient has not yet fully engaged might exist, which might assist the patient in moving forward on goals. The patient can also download smartphone applications that help with planning activities and that send reminders. 3. Pleasant activities are the best first step. Pleasant activities are doubly beneficial to the patient, as they increase activity and feelings of pleasure. Activities designed to overcome avoidance or increase a sense of accomplishment should be entertained as the first goals only if highly important to the patient or apparently salient to the attainment of future goals. Highlight 13.1 Summary of Steps Step 1. Introduce behavioral activation and its potential influence to the patient. Step 2. Use patient examples to show relationship between mood and behavior. Step 3. Identify pleasant activities/active-coping behaviors. Step 4. Set an action plan. Step 5. Monitor progress. 4. It is important to monitor anxiety and avoid behavioral activation procedures that further aid in the patient\u2019s avoidance of fearful situations (e.g., presenting problem is avoiding interpersonal difficulties with spouse, and patient chooses to shop or be on the internet for pleasure but specifically when spouse is in the house to avoid confrontation/talking about issues). The goal is to introduce behaviors that will facilitate improvements in the patient\u2019s life, while not reinforcing avoidance of uncomfortable situations and emotions.  ",

The goal is to introduce behaviors that will facilitate improvements in the patient\u2019s life, while not reinforcing avoidance of uncomfortable situations and emotions.  For example, patients with anxiety symptoms often avoid situations out of fear of negative consequence occurring in response to engaging in a particular activity. Although behavioral activation can aid these patients, you must also understand that the activity itself is not reinforcing (pleasant) but rather feared. It is only the resulting completion of the task that may generate positive affect (e.g., I faced my fear, and nothing terrible happened). This response differs from depression in that depressed patients will often look at behavioral activation as a positive outcome in and of itself (e.g., \"exercising is enjoyable,\" or \"I love talking with my granddaughter\").

Exposure therapy is an approach commonly used to treat anxiety conditions (namely, panic, agoraphobia, social phobia, and specific phobias \u2013 such as animals, heights, flying, choking, and blood-injury-injection). Exposure therapy is defined by its systematic approach to confronting feared stimuli in the presence of a safe environment. Feared stimuli can be external (e.g., objects, activities, situations) or internal (e.g., feared thoughts, physical sensations). The aim of exposure therapy is to reduce the patient\u2019s anxiety response to feared stimuli and increase the patient\u2019s ability to experience and tolerate anxiety. The process includes creating a thoughtfully constructed hierarchy of feared stimuli organized by the patient\u2019s reported degree of fear. The patient and provider systematically work their way up the hierarchy by exposing the patient to the feared stimuli with a variety of exposure exercises, allowing the patient to habituate to their anxiety over time. Exposure therapy is rooted in classical conditioning theory, which posits that fear, an emotion, becomes linked with previously neutral or unfeared stimuli through cognitive and emotional processes that result in associated symptoms of anxiety. Subsequently, anxiety becomes a conditioned behavioral response to these stimuli through the activation of fear and engagement in avoidance/escape behaviors. It is important to note that these previously neutral stimuli may be animate (e.g., spiders, clowns, people), inanimate (e.g., toilets, knives, numbers, places), situational (e.g., driving, darkness, feeling uncertain), cognitive (e.g., \u201cimpure\u201d thoughts, memories of traumatic events, premonitions), or physiological (e.g., racing heart, feeling out of breath, flushed skin) and would not otherwise elicit a strong or intense fear response. Exposure therapy seeks to \u201cundo\u201d this prior associative learning by reducing the conditioned anxiety/fear response through repeated confrontation with the feared stimuli. Most importantly, the individual undergoing exposure therapy must learn to tolerate the fear while building self-efficacy within the context of processing emotional reactions (see Figure 14.1). 101 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 14 Figure 14.1.

Breaking the cycle of anxiety  ELEMENTS OF EXPOSURE Exposure therapy, typically delivered in 8 to 12 sessions in specialty mental health settings, is efficacious for anxiety disorders as well as other conditions such as obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Hofmann & Smits, 2008; Rauch, et al. 2012). Although exposure therapy requires adequate time for extinction, recent advances in treatment have shown that briefer formats of exposure therapy (e.g., four to six sessions) are effective for patients with anxiety and PTSD (Cigrang, et al. 2017). Exposure therapy is generally conducted using one or a combination of different types of exposure exercises: \u2022 Imaginal exposure, or exposure to one\u2019s own thoughts and mental images, may be used to help patients experience their most feared thoughts more fully. Sometimes, imaginal exposure may be used as a first step toward a strongly feared in vivo exercise. An example of an imaginal exposure is to have patients write a short story in which the things they fear the most eventually come true. \u2022 Interoceptive exposure, or exposure to physiologic sensations associated with anxiety and panic symptoms, should be used to systematically \u201cexpose\u201d patients to the most common somatic symptoms associated with their fear responses. This should be done in a controlled way to ensure the health and safety of the patient. Interoceptive exercises may include simulation exercises and naturalistic activities to help patients increase their tolerance of physiologic bodily sensations without using safety behaviors. \u2022 In vivo exposure, or real-life exposure to feared objects or situations, may be used to help patients overcome anxiety and panic insomuch as they negatively impact their quality of life. In-vivo exposure is associated with reduced symptoms of anxiety and panic, PTSD, and OCD over the long term.  102 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 14 Table 14.1 lists common terms and elements often associated with exposure therapy.

Graded exposure The use of a fear hierarchy to systematically and gradually expose an individual to increasingly distressing objects, situations, or activities. Habituation Decreasing the intensity of anxiety reactions to feared objects or situations over time through repeated exposure. Panic Sudden uncontrollable fear or anxiety that often involves psychological and biological (bodily sensations) reactions. Within exposure therapy, fear associated with bodily sensations decreased by building tolerance to the sensation during exposure exercises. Safety Behaviors Behaviors used by patients to tolerate or reduce fear and, thus, avoid exposure to the feared object or situation.  During exposure work,  important to monitor and avoid safety behaviors during exposure exercises. Ultimate goal of exposure therapy:  to translate skills into real-world situations;  important to help patients minimize use of safety behaviors in their daily lives. Stress Stress -- the way in which the body responds to any demand or challenge. Experienced  daily by everyone. Importantly, not all stress bad but long-term stress harmful to  health. SUDs Subjective units of distress. Commonly used to \u201cquantify\u201d levels of perceived stress.  Typically used on a 0-100 scale. Systematic desensitization Combining exposure with relaxation exercises to make them more manageable. However, pairing with relaxation may interfere with the exposure experience. Must be monitored accordingly.  Relaxation techniques possibly best used after the exposure exercise is completed. Worry A state of anxiety and uncertainty over actual or potential problems. Usually related to something impending or anticipated. 103 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 14 SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ELEMENTS IN EXPOSURE THERAPY \u2022 Identification and articulation of the specific feared objects, activities, and situations, as well as the associated anxiety symptoms (for monitoring and fear hierarchy construction). \u2022 Development of comprehensive fear hierarchy. \u2022 Selecting feasible and clear exposure exercises.

When? (Indications/Contraindications) Ultimately, you should use your clinical judgment and the most current empirical literature to determine the most appropriate course of treatment when considering exposure therapy as an option. The information contained in this module provides an overview and basic strategies for using an exposure-based approach in a brief setting.  However, these basic strategies may not be appropriate for specialty mental health settings dealing with more complicated presentations. Because brief approaches to psychotherapy are not appropriate for all clinical presentations, we encourage providers to use specific (and often more intensive) treatment protocols when facing more severe or complicated clinical presentations of anxiety.  For patients with less severe symptoms or when full protocols are simply not feasible \u2013 providers may consider the techniques in this chapter \u2013 while recognizing the potential limitations. Exposure interventions require appropriate provider technical expertise and adequate time for learning, reflection, and extinction of fear responses.  Clinical situations in which these ingredients are not present should be approached carefully or with additional supports/alternatives. For example, most brief exposure-based protocols require four to six sessions, at minimum. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR BRIEF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY: 1. Exposure therapy is an emotionally intense experience for patients and may lead to avoidance of therapy to avoid exposure exercises. Exposure should be graded and based on the patient\u2019s presenting fear and fear hierarchy (explained later in this chapter). 2. Technical expertise on the part of the provider is required.  Homework and in- session exposures must be done accurately, effectively, and efficiently (e.g., detailed hierarchies and appropriately targeted interventions) to avoid unnecessary negative patient experiences. 3. If you are unfamiliar with exposure principles, consult with other providers and/or receive supervision for initial or complex cases. 104 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 14 4. Consider medication referral (e.g., antidepressants or benzodiazepine) with an awareness that medications may serve to increase feelings of safety (e.g., safety behaviors) and could compromise exposure-therapy impact if used to reduce anxiety during exposure sessions.

INITIAL STEPS: BUILDING THE FOUNDATION Assessment and Psychoeducation Initial steps should focus on gathering information about patients\u2019 symptoms, feelings, thoughts, and behaviors regarding the feared stimulus. Specifically, you need to clearly understand factors associated with the onset and maintenance of symptoms (i.e., precipitating circumstances, symptom duration), as well as alleviating or exacerbating factors. Figure 14.2 is an example of how to assess for this information. 105 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 14 Figure 14.2. Example Anxiety Assessment Handout Psychoeducation is critical to provide an accurate foundation about fear and to help avoid misunderstandings. You should provide the patient with a comprehensive understanding of the fear response, including symptoms related to fear responses, mechanisms that maintain symptoms, and common myths associated with exposure treatment (see Table 14.2). Symptom monitoring, a foundation for symptom management in CBT, should be introduced through structured worksheets and exercises. Physical Signs: How does your body react to worry/stress?

Common Myths Related to Fear and Exposure Introduction to Exposure Treatment Actively inform your patients about the nature of exposure treatment (e.g., in-vivo, imaginal, or interoceptive exposures) and a rationale behind the approach. It is important to communicate that exposure exercises will be done gradually, in a predictable manner, safely, and under your control as the provider. Exposure therapy yields positive outcomes when done correctly and when the patient understands the rationale. Often, patients may feel that exposure therapy is daunting or overwhelming.  Regularly check-in with patients before and during the process to ensure that patients display high levels of self-efficacy to complete the exposure process. You should refer to other modules in this guide outlining other skills to address concerns that may impede success with exposure therapy (i.e., cognitive restructuring, relaxation). Receiving benefits from exposure therapy requires continued practice in-session and between sessions. The more the patient can complete exposure exercises, the more their fear will begin to decrease. Habituating to fear is a learned process that has to be reinforced over time. You and your patient will practice exposure in session, but the patient will have to practice exposure exercises three to four times each week, depending on the activity. Myth Fact Anxiety is not very common. People with anxiety are weak. Nearly one in five people experiences some type of anxiety disorder in any given year. Anxiety and stress happen to us all. Anxiety will get better over time if you just leave things alone. Anxiety and fear lead to avoidance, which maintains the response over time. Exposure and facing fears and anxiety are effective at reducing anxiety and fear. Therapy for anxiety will take years. Most anxiety conditions can be treated effectively in 10- 12 weekly sessions. Anxiety reductions can often be seen within the first weeks of therapy, and some providers offer abbreviated treatment that involve four to six sessions. A panic attack can make you lose control or pass out. Fainting usually occurs from a sudden decrease in blood pressure and is not associated with panic attacks. Someone with anxiety should avoid situations that cause stress. Avoiding stress often leads to immediate reductions in anxiety but creates a host of additional problems, including avoidance and continued fear responses. Often, what feels natural (e.g., avoiding stress) actually turns out to maintain or make anxiety worse. ",

Often, what feels natural (e.g., avoiding stress) actually turns out to maintain or make anxiety worse. 107 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 14 Collaboratively Building a Fear Hierarchy Collaboratively building a hierarchy of feared situations and formulating a treatment plan are critical steps for exposure.  Leverage your patient\u2019s daily symptom recordings (e.g., panic attack records, daily mood ratings, avoidance of stimuli reports) to facilitate a comprehensive fear hierarchy. The patient can use levels of anxiety, distress, or panic to identify a list of feared situations, animals, objects, or sensations. The patient should account or track distress over a period of time or use historical evidence to begin forming the hierarchy. You and your patient will work together to decide target stimuli for the exposure exercises in treatment, based on the patient\u2019s presenting concerns, reported symptoms and case conceptualization. Once stimuli are chosen, work with the patient to create specific and detailed targets to base exposure exercises on, ranked by SUD (subjective units of distress) levels. These targets should be detailed enough for you to create an exposure exercise tailored to the patient\u2019s fear. You should work to understand why the patient fears certain stimuli. For example, a patient may fear and avoid going to grocery stores. The fear could be because the patient has social anxiety and fears embarrassment. Or, the patient could fear having a panic attack in the middle of the store in front of others and not being able to escape. As part of the construction of the fear hierarchy, you must also attend to patient safety behaviors that contribute to the maintenance of anxiety and may undermine future exposure exercises.

Example Hierarchy Targeted avoidance behavior: Avoiding grocery stores with too many people MORE DIFFICULT EASIER Buying a full list of groceries at the store by myself around 6pm Buying multiple items at the grocery store in the longest line at 6pm Buying one item in the grocery store around 6pm after 10 minutes Walking around the grocery store for 10 minutes by myself around 6pm Walking around the grocery store by myself around 11am Walking around the grocery store for 10 minutes with a friend around 6pm 108 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 14 INTERMEDIATE STEPS: EFFICIENT USE OF EXPOSURE An exposure activity is essentially broken into a series of seven steps.

Exposure starts with a low-level feared exercise according to the fear hierarchy to prevent inducing a response too high for the patient to cope with and to increase the likelihood of the patient\u2019s habituating to the response.  Providers should ensure that safety behaviors are accounted for and monitored during the exposure exercise. Before and after the exposure, collect fear/anxiety symptom ratings as well as the patient\u2019s cognitive and emotional response to the exercise to correct unhelpful thinking or behaviors, and commend the patient for completing the activity. Following successful completion of the exercise, work collaboratively with your patient to move up the fear hierarchy until symptom remission is attained. Repeated practice is critical for symptom remission. Treatment Duration and Frequency Exposure sessions may vary in terms of duration and temporal spacing as well as the level of involvement of the provider and/or significant others. Duration of treatment may be short or longer term. Shorter durations may include single sessions or abbreviated/ weekend treatments, but such work often uses longer sessions and may be facilitated through delivery in group settings where interpersonal learning is possible between patients. Temporal spacing of sessions may include the traditional one session per week over a period of four to six weeks (or more) but may also be spaced such that exposure is heavily weighted at the beginning\u2014with high levels of provider involvement\u2014and then tapered into less frequent sessions (greater spacing between sessions) and/or less involvement of the provider. An exposure exercise is typically completed in session, and then the patient is instructed to complete more exercises at home. The exercise consists of a series of trials. Each trial consists of the same level of exposure to the fear stimuli, over a period of time, within the same time frame. For example, the patient may complete 10 trials of sitting in a dark room for 20-second intervals within 15 minutes total. Or, the patient may read an imaginal exposure script you both created three times during 15 minutes. Ultimately, by you in collaboration with patients in terms of their needs and preferences of the patient. Attention to Safety Behaviors Critical processes for exposure therapy require interoceptive and in vivo exposure as well as careful attention to the restriction of safety behaviors that undermine the exposure activity.

Attention to Safety Behaviors Critical processes for exposure therapy require interoceptive and in vivo exposure as well as careful attention to the restriction of safety behaviors that undermine the exposure activity.  Exposure requires that a patient tolerate and accept anxiety and fear rather than avoid it through compensatory strategies.  For example, the goal of an exposure exercise is to learn to tolerate the distress associated with the feared stimulus. Other CBT skills such as cognitive restructuring and relaxation skills should not be used during an exposure exercise, as they can serve as \u201cdistractions\u201d and may reduce the experience of the exposure itself, serving only to prolong or solidify the fear. Additionally, the use of anti-anxiety medications (e.g., benzodiazepines) has been found to complicate and even negatively impact treatment outcomes both immediately and over time. 109 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 14 More examples of safety behaviors: \u2022 A patient who goes to the grocery store only with a friend so the friend can stand in the long lines. \u2022 A patient who sits closest to the exit during meetings in case of a panic attack and they need to get out quickly. \u2022 A patient who carries paper towels in case they start sweating in front of others. Steps of Exposure Exercise: 1. Choose exposure activity (e.g., interoceptive exposure, in-vivo exposure, imaginal exposure) a. Imaginal exposure i. Goal: Indirectly increase tolerance of a feared object or situation to allow a corrective learning experience through vivid imagination. ii. You choose this exercise when real-life exposure to that feared stimuli is not feasible or would be too intense for the patient to do at that time. iii. Imaginal exposure consists of you and your patient writing a detailed scenario of the feared stimuli, in first person. The scenario should include vivid details that tap into the patient\u2019s specific fears and include the worst possible outcome of the feared situation. The patient reads the script completely as one trial of the exposure. iv. Examples: Imagining standing on top of a skyscraper, imagining talking to a friend, imagining a traumatic experience from the past, imagining taking a plane ride, or imagining not locking the house door b. Interoceptive exposure i. Goal: Increase tolerance of a feared bodily sensation or physical response to allow a corrective learning experience. ii. You would choose interoceptive exposures when the feared stimulus is experiencing a bodily sensation. The patient will build tolerance to a specific sensation with repeated exposure over time. ",

In vivo exposure i. Goal: Directly increase tolerance of a feared object or situation to allow a corrective learning experience in real life. ii. Choose this type of exposure when the patient is ready to build tolerance in situations that are accessible in real life. These exposures can be conducted during the session but often will be planned for the patient to complete in between sessions. iii. Examples: Staying on an elevator, remaining in dark environments, being surrounded in crowds, purposely standing in long lines, holding a snake, touching a spider, giving a speech in front of an audience, or talking to a stranger 2. Monitor safety behaviors. a. It is important to help patients understand safety behaviors (i.e., overt behavioral or covert internal thoughts and beliefs) and signals (i.e., internal or external cues of safety) as an unhelpful part of their fear response that maintains their symptoms. 2. Assess for anticipatory anxiety subjective units of distress (SUDs). a. It is important to help patients understand their levels of anxiety and distress as they complete exposure exercises in-session as well as homework assignments. SUDS range from 0 to 100 and function as an emotional thermometer, where 0 is perfectly relaxed, and 100 is the worst anxiety and distress ever experienced. b. It is useful to rate SUDs before beginning an exposure exercise. 4. Conduct exposure with specified duration or trial number. a. It is important to agree upon the number of exposure trials as well as the duration of such beforehand. b.  It may be best to think of duration in terms of the cumulative length of time of an exposure exercise as well as the amount of time it may take for SUDs to decrease to a sufficient level. 5. Assess for SUDs/intensity of sensations. a. The general goal is for the SUDs to reduce across the repeated trials. b. ",

You may find it difficult to develop an effective hierarchy and might struggle to identify an exposure exercise that leads to an appropriate level of intensity.  As with other treatment types, trial and error (with reflection) and clinical consultation are critical to modifying and refining exposure-based treatments. Exposure may require modifications depending on the feared stimulus.  For example, it is common for patients with blood-injury-injection phobias to experience a fainting response (a physiological reaction that is associated with increased heart rate and blood pressure) during exposure exercises. Prior to exposure exercises, counter measures or techniques such as applied tension strategies (tensing the large muscle groups) may be required to reduce heart rate and blood pressure spikes and, therefore, avoid a fainting response. 111 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 14 TERMINATING STEPS: ADVANCED PRACTICE CONSIDERATIONS Dealing with Setbacks Setbacks are also learning experiences if handled accordingly. You should prepare your patients for setbacks, as they are a normal and an expected part of growth and development.  Building a foundation that includes setbacks helps to ensure open communication between the provider and patient about both positive and negative therapy experiences. If patients accept that setbacks will occur, you will be in a strong position to use any setbacks as growth and development for building skills and maintaining future changes. Involving Others Significant others can have a positive or negative impact on the maintenance of fear and anxiety.  Although others may provide invaluable support for a specific treatment plan, they may also serve to unknowingly maintain anxiety by providing safety and support during critical exposure work.  Providers who directly involve significant others in anxiety management treatments must ensure that communication is effective. Others involved in the care plan must have appropriate psychoeducation about anxiety and fear and ways anxiety is maintained. REFERENCES AND SUPPLEMENTAL READINGS Barlow, D. H. & Craske, M. C.

Problem-solving techniques generally involve a process by which individuals attempt to identify effective means of coping with problems of everyday living. This often involves a set of steps for analyzing a problem, identifying options for coping, evaluating the options, deciding upon a plan, and developing strategies for implementing the plan. Problem-solving strategies can be used with a wide range of problems, including depression, anxiety, anger and aggression, stress management, coping with medical illness, addiction, and relationship/family difficulties. Problem-solving techniques teach skills that aid the patient in feeling increased control over life issues that previously felt overwhelming or unmanageable. In this manner, problem solving can help with practical problem resolution as well as emotion-focused coping (e.g., increasing control, decreasing stress, and increasing hopefulness). When? (Indications/Contraindications) Thoughts and beliefs are challenged when a thought or belief is not true or a situation is unchangeable. Alternatively, problem solving may be used when the root of an issue is a changeable situation; and the thoughts associated with the noxious situation might be accurate. Problem solving can be especially effective when a specific problem is able to be addressed and operationalized. A specific operationalized problem is one that is easily explained, identified, and/or measured. Problem solving works best when a practical solution is available. For example, a patient complaining of social isolation likely has potential solutions to this difficulty (e.g., calling a friend, joining a group, engaging in a socially driven hobby). Examples of problems appropriate for problem solving include: 1. How to communicate with a partner about a difficult issue 2. ",

In this manner you are a facilitator who possesses problem-solving skills. 113 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 15 PROBLEM SOLVING MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALS: 1. Patients with serious mental illness (psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder) 2. Patients with severe depression, who might require more focused cognitive work or medications 3. Patients who have difficulty thinking about long-term effects (e.g., persons with cognitive impairment) 4. Patients with problems that are largely emotional; for example, a person who feels incompetent at work and often feels that others are overly critical may be reacting to emotions (e.g., depression). This problem may be better served using another skill (e.g., Unhelpful Thoughts modules). How? (Instructions/Handouts) PROBLEM-SOLVING THERAPY (PST) In problem-solving therapy, it is important that you first educate the patient about the problem-solving strategies that will be used during sessions. To enable patients to use the strategies after therapy ends, teach them to carefully examine a problem, create a list of solutions, and make decisions about which strategies are appropriate for a variety of problems. General guidelines for using problem-solving strategies are as follows: \u2022 Training should be tailored and specific to each patient. \u2022 Obtain a thorough assessment of the problem before proceeding with problem- solving therapy. \u2022 Encourage the patient to try as many solutions as possible. \u2022 Decide whether the patient requires more problem-solving work or more emotional work to experience growth through the therapeutic process. STRATEGIES FOR EFFECTIVE PROBLEM SOLVING The SOLVED technique helps guide you through the steps to most effectively identify and solve problems in your life. S (Selecting a Problem) ... the patient would like to solve. Ask the patient to think about situations when they feel distress or difficulty problem solving. If planning does not seem to be possible, suggest a different therapeutic technique (e.g., changing unhelpful thoughts). The decision to remain with problem solving or move to a different skill is largely dependent on you to direct. ",

You are encouraged to work with patients to \u201cbrainstorm\u201d all possible solutions. Writing may be particularly helpful for some patients. Even ideas that seem ridiculous at first may generate realistic solutions. In-Session Example 15.1 For example, Allison\u2019s family would often drop by several times a week without calling beforehand and expect her to care for their children. She enjoyed this but felt tired many times and was beginning to get concerned about her ability to continue child sitting at such a frequent pace. Her first idea was to tell them she could no longer baby-sit. Although she did not like this idea, it led her to consider related ideas, such as telling them they had to call beforehand to make sure she felt up to the task. Highlight 15.1 Tips for generating possible solutions: \u2022 Ask the patient to think about advice they would give someone else with this problem. \u2022 Ask the patient to examine the ways they have handled similar situations. \u2022 Instruct the patient to consult with a close friend or relative for additional solutions. L (Listing the Potential Pros and Cons of Each Potential Solution) Often, writing options, along with listing pros and cons, can be helpful in considering potential options. Writing allows additional thought, as well as a visual image of options. Recommend that patients consider solutions in a logical manner, thus reducing the time spent ruminating. It may also help to identify additional thoughts that might benefit from changes using the techniques, such as changing thoughts. In some cases, identification of pros/cons may require obtaining information from other people, such as lawyers or financial advisors. V (Verifying the Best Solution) Examine the pros and cons of the solutions listed. Patients may wish to \u201crank order\u201d the solutions based on which solutions are most practical and/or desirable. E (Enacting the Plan) Identify the steps needed to carry out the solution selected. Patients may need to break actions down into steps small enough to facilitate achievement of goals. Once you and the patient finish formulating a specific plan, encourage the patient to carry it out. ",

If the solution was effective, give positive reinforcement. If the solution was not effective, return to the first step in the SOLVED technique to specify a new problem or move to \u201cO\u201d or \u201cL\u201d to identify other goals or potential solutions for the same problem. The decision to move back and to which step is largely up to you, who might now have additional information about pros and cons and possible solutions. PROBLEM-SOLVING EXAMPLES To facilitate patient learning, you might wish to provide examples of the SOLVED program at work. The following section provides several examples of the SOLVED technique.

Relaxation techniques consist of a collection of psychotherapeutic techniques designed to reduce tension, stress, worry, and/or anxiety. Relaxation techniques vary in their focus (e.g., physical sensations or changes in cognition/thoughts) and can be selected based on presenting difficulties, as well as patient preferences. Some patients respond to physical procedures (e.g., muscle relaxation and/or deep breathing), while others respond favorably to guided imagery. Relaxation techniques are important for brief therapy for several reasons. First, they focus on skills that alleviate stress, anxiety, worry, and tension that are often debilitating and interfere with patient functioning. Second, stress, anxiety, worry, and tension are often very uncomfortable for patients; and providing help to alleviate distress can go a long way towards increasing positive treatment expectations and rapport. Relaxation techniques are easily conveyed as a method of increasing control and often do not include a direct discussion of mental health difficulties, which can be important for some patients who are concerned about mental health stigma. Finally, relaxation techniques are generally easy to teach and learn. ",

Finally, relaxation techniques are generally easy to teach and learn. For these reasons, it is often advantageous to teach these techniques early in treatment to give patients an easy-to- learn, yet highly effective, skill set. When? (Indications/Contraindications) As indicated, relaxation techniques are quite effective early in treatment to reduce tension and increase early treatment successes. They generate increased self-efficacy, perceived control over stress, and improved coping. Examples of applications might include daily relaxation exercises to reduce an overall sense of tension or stress not affiliated with any specific situation (e.g., general worry or apprehension) or the use of relaxation techniques to manage work-related stress in preparation for an upcoming social or family event. Relaxation procedures can also be appropriate for persons with depressive symptoms to increase their perceptions of control. However, it might not be appropriate for depressive symptoms occurring outside comorbid anxiety/worry. For example, teaching a severely depressed person, who is experiencing fatigue and lack of motivation, to relax would not be useful unless the patient has a specific need for relaxation. Additionally, relaxation techniques might not be appropriate for patients with anxiety and panic symptoms as they may use them as avoidance behaviors. Use of relaxation when faced with feared stimuli can reinforce anxiety and further exacerbate fear. 120 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 16 Relaxation techniques are appropriate for persons with chronic pain, migraines, and insomnia, as well as in smoking cessation treatment and weight management programs. These techniques can aid in symptom reduction and underlying issues that make it difficult for patients to cope with physical ailments. However, it is important to consider how various relaxation techniques are impacted by any physical limitations. How? (Instructions/Handouts) Regardless of the actual relaxation technique, it is imperative that the physical environment be attended to so as to maximize results. Before beginning relaxation techniques, it is suggested that you create a safe, quiet, and comfortable environment. You are encouraged to work with patients to create such an environment. Patients may be comfortable with certain recommendations (e.g., unfolding arms) but may be uncertain or uncomfortable with others (e.g., closing their eyes). The following list of options can be used to create an effective atmosphere for relaxation-based interventions. Setting up the room: \u2022 Comfortable chair (a high-backed chair to support the patient\u2019s neck, if possible) \u2022 Safe and relaxing room (e.g.",

You largely determine selection of a specific technique, but you should select it with the patient's expressed interests and learning preferences/abilities in mind. For example, patients who are largely somatically focused may prefer muscle relaxation or deep breathing. Other patients, especially those who appreciate the association between thoughts and mood, might be best served using guided imagery procedures. However, the ultimate decision of which procedure to use may relate to exposure to all three techniques and a trial-and-error approach. 121 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 16 PROGRESSIVE MUSCLE RELAXATION (PMR) PMR consists of learning how to tense and then relax various groups of muscles all through the body in a sequential fashion, while paying close attention to the feelings associated with both tension and relaxation. Although muscle relaxation has been around for many years, it has become more popular recently for dealing with different anxiety and panic disorders. With this procedure, the patient learns how to relax and how to recognize and pinpoint tension and relaxation in the body to identify tension and reduce its influence before each reaches high levels/impairment. In teaching patients muscle relaxation, you should first explain the reason for using muscle relaxation and how it will benefit the patient (rationale). You should also give a full explanation and demonstration of how it is done. Step #1: PMR Increases Control. Introduce PMR principles and procedures. PMR begins by letting patients know that they can create sensations of relaxation and that this process of \u201cinducing\u201d relaxation begins by being able to identify and discriminate between sensations of tension and relaxation. Step #2: Note the Incongruence of Tension and Relaxation. ",

Step #2: Note the Incongruence of Tension and Relaxation. Inform the patient that sensations of tension and relaxation cannot occur at the same time. No muscles in the body can be tensed and relaxed at the same time. This principle is critical, and you should ensure that patients fully understand how this applies to their current difficulties. Step #3: Identify States of Tension. Explain to the patient that tension often builds gradually without conscious awareness. Learning to detect the initial signs of an increase is an important step towards avoiding a full-blown occurrence of tension. Inform patients that, no matter the level of intensity, they can stop and reverse the tension using knowledge of PMR \u2013 in essence, it is never too late to reduce tension. Over time patients become increasingly skilled at identifying stress earlier and earlier (e.g., their awareness increases). Step #4: Tense Muscle Groups. Highlight 16.2 A brief word of caution: If at any point during the technique a patient experiences pain, alter or completely discontinue the technique. If the patient experiences chronic pain in any part of the body, it is best to avoid the tensing component when the patient gets to those muscle groups. PMR asks the patient to tense and release different muscle groups in sequence, moving from the arms to the face, neck, chest and shoulders, torso, and legs. For each specific muscle group, it\u2019s important to try to tense only that muscle group during the tensing part of the exercise. Throughout the procedure, it is important to concentrate on the sensations produced by the different exercises. Asking the patient to describe bodily sensations is 122 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 16 very important for the learning process. Statements or phrases from you might include: \u201cWhat are you noticing about your body right now?\u201d These questions help the patient to focus on the way the body \u201cfeels\u201d when tense and relaxed. TENSING INSTRUCTIONS Model each tension procedure. Ask the patient to practice, and provide feedback. Check to be sure that the patient can identify tension in each group before moving on to the next. a. Dominant arm. Make a fist and tense biceps; pull wrist upward, while pushing elbow down against the arm of chair or bed. b. Nondominant arm. Same as above. ",

Pull chin down toward chest; at the same time, try to prevent it from actually touching the chest. Counterpose muscles in front part of neck against those in the back part of neck. e. Shoulders, chest, and upper back/abdomen. Take a deep breath and hold it. At the same time, pull the shoulder blades back and together, trying to make them touch. Try to keep your arms as relaxed as possible while tensing this muscle group. At the same time make the stomach hard by pressing it out, as if someone were going to hit you in the stomach. f. Dominant leg. Lift foot off the floor and push down on the chair with thigh. g. Nondominant leg. Same as above. Step #5: Debrief After the Exercise. After relaxation training, question the patient about his or her reaction to the muscle- relaxation exercise. It is also important to make any adjustments needed to the training. Monitor any pain the patient experienced to adapt and improve the technique for the individual patient\u2019s needs. Step #6: Continue to Practice Outside Session. It will be important for the patients to practice PMR at least once a day over the first week or two to build skills and confidence. As they become increasingly skilled at PMR, they might find it possible to relax without having to actively tense the muscles. The patients should use regularly scheduled homework to practice in a nondistracting environment. When they have learned to relax in a calm environment, it should be easier to relax in more distracting situations, whenever they notice tension developing. 123 DEEP-BREATHING TECHNIQUE Another physiological-based relaxation technique is deep breathing. Deep breathing focuses on reducing rapid and shallow (ineffective) breathing that often occurs during periods of stress, worry, or anxiety. Rapid and shallow breaths can lead the patient to have decreased oxygen in the system, which can cause hyperventilation, dizziness, lightheadedness, or decreased ability to concentrate. Alternatively, taking a deep, full breath can produce a feeling of calmness or slowing by increasing oxygen-rich blood flow. ",

Alternatively, taking a deep, full breath can produce a feeling of calmness or slowing by increasing oxygen-rich blood flow. It can also strengthen muscles in the chest and stomach, which can make it easier to breathe on a daily basis. STEPS TO DEEP BREATHING: Step #1: Introduce the patient to Deep Breathing. Indicate why Deep Breathing was chosen, and provide an overview of the procedures and potential benefits. Step #2: Ask the patient to put one hand on the abdomen, with the little finger about one inch above the navel, and to place one hand on the chest. Step #3: Ask the patient to pay attention to their breathing (pause for several seconds to allow the patient the opportunity to assess breathing) and then to tell you which hand is doing more of the moving. Ideally, the hand on the abdomen should be moving; while the hand over the chest remains still. This ensures that the breaths are deep. Step #4: Work with the patient to take deeper breaths by getting the hand over the stomach to move while having little movement of the hand over the chest. Inform the patient, \u201dYour hand on your diaphragm should move out as you inhale and in as you exhale.\u201d Highlight 16.3 NOTE: Patients with a lung or heart condition might have difficulty with deep breathing. If patients report difficulty, slow the process down and help them to maximize the exercise comfortably. Step #5: To pace the patient, you might suggest saying the words in and out slowly, while taking breaths. Inhalations and exhalations should build to approximately three seconds in duration. Step #6: Ask patients if they notice any changes in breathing and feelings of relaxation. Ask for general feedback about the technique. Step #7: Repeat the breathing exercise three or more times until the patient reports skill understanding and benefit. Step #8: Ask the patient to identify situations when deep breathing might be appropriate.  ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 16 124 Step #9: Continue practice outside of session. Work with the patient to set a homework assignment that encourages application of Deep Breathing to situations when the patient feels stress. Highlight 16.4 Other tips for Deep Breathing: 1. Inhale through nose and out of mouth. 2. Ask patient to purse lips (as if blowing on hot soup) while exhaling. 3. Do not pause between inhales and exhales. 4. Ask patient to close eyes during the exercise. 5. Patient may want to use mantra such as \u201crelax\u201d during each exhale. ",

Pair up deep breathing with imagery once the patient has begun to master breathing skills. 7. Point out that deep breathing is a portable skill that can be used in a variety of situations and relatively without notice of others (PMR is less portable). IMAGERY Imagery is a cognitive relaxation technique that can be used to ease stress and promote an overall sense of well-being. Imagery focuses on increasing cognitive, emotional, and physical control by changing the focus of an individual\u2019s thoughts. We all have daydreamed about pleasant things that have distracted us and made us feel better. Imagery uses much the same process but encourages positive adaptive \u201cdreaming\u201d that distracts and relaxes the individual. Imagery is highly effective for depression and anxiety, as well as specific situations that require clarity, focus, distraction, or feelings of mastery. The following are examples: Table 16.1 Imagery Examples ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 16 TOPIC FOCUSED TOPIC IMAGE OUTCOME Depression Negative Self-worth Images of success or past situations of success, images of a pleasant past experience Increased self-confidence, reduced negative thoughts\u2019 distraction from negative mood Anxiety/ Worry Public Speaking Image of speech that goes well, image of something funny Reduced negative focus, distraction, increased positive expectations Medical Anxiety Fear of Procedure (e.g., needles) Relaxation, peacefulness, pain-free environment Less tension, reduced anxiety, toleration of procedure with less distress Sports Performance Focused efforts during golf game Envisioning the desired shot, positive words of advice Increased focus, increased self- confidence, positive thinking 125 How Guided Imagery Works Research has shown that the mind can affect how the body functions. It seems the body may not know the difference between an actual event and a thought. Guided imagery uses the power of the brain\u2014images and the perception that you are either somewhere else or in a different state of mind\u2014to increase pleasant experiences and performance to promote wellness and health. On the flip side, imagery helps to reduce stress tension and anxiety by changing thoughts and emotions or through distraction. Imagery is commonly referred to as guided imagery. Guided imagery refers to a process whereby you facilitate or guide the initial images the patient uses. The following section describes how you can guide the patient into the effective use of imagery for relaxation or performance improvement. Step #1: Introduce Imagery. ",

Guided imagery refers to a process whereby you facilitate or guide the initial images the patient uses. The following section describes how you can guide the patient into the effective use of imagery for relaxation or performance improvement. Step #1: Introduce Imagery. Introduce imagery to the patient, pointing out the power of the brain or thoughts and how images, when accessed correctly, can change physical and emotional states. Step #2: Identify the Desired Outcomes, Such as Decreased Anxiety, Increased Focus, Distraction. Step #3: Develop an Image or Scene. Work with the patient on the third step to identify a situation, either in the past or a desirable place to be, that both you and the patient feel might benefit or produce the desired outcome. Sample imagery scripts are provided below and can be used if the patient has difficulty creating a personal situation. Selection of a powerful image is critical to the success of this technique. Selection of an image that the patient is able to fully embrace increases the odds of treatment success. Selection of a \u201cweak\u201d image (e.g., not viewed as important by the patient or unable to be fully visualized) will likely lead to treatment failure. Step #4: Increase Vividness of the Image. To ensure that patients find a \u201cstrong\u201d image, ask them to explore as many senses as possible to increase vividness of the image. For example, when imagining a glass of lemonade, imagine holding a glass that feels icy and cold; visualize the color of the lemonade; think of the fresh citrus smell; and, finally, think of how the lemonade tastes. This is an example of imagery that uses multiple senses and increases vividness of the image. Increasing vividness is largely a matter of increasing the details the patient experiences. The more details described by the patient, the more powerful the technique. Step #5: Ask Patients if They Notice Any Changes After the Imagery Exercise. Ask for general feedback about the technique. Step #6: Repeat the Imagery Exercise Until the Patient Reports Skill Understanding and Benefit. ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 16 126 Step #7: Ask the Patient to Identify Situations When Imagery Might Be Appropriate. Expand upon the patient\u2019s responses by adding other situations (e.g., how the technique can be used). Step #8: Continue Practice Outside Session. Work with the patient to set a homework assignment that encourages application of imagery to situations when the patient feels stress or feels that imagery might be beneficial.

Expand upon the patient\u2019s responses by adding other situations (e.g., how the technique can be used). Step #8: Continue Practice Outside Session. Work with the patient to set a homework assignment that encourages application of imagery to situations when the patient feels stress or feels that imagery might be beneficial. Highlight 16.5 Other tips for imagery: 1. Pair up imagery with deep-breathing exercises. 2. Ask patient to close eyes during the exercise to increase vividness. 3. Interject during the imagery experience aspects that you feel might benefit the patient. For example, a patient might use a beach image; and you might ask how the sun feels on the skin, whether there are sounds, or what else is visible. 4. Help the patient focus on aspects of the image that will guide them towards the goal. Help the patient to avoid too many unnecessary details that might distract from the goal. 5. Point out that imagery is a portable skill that the patient can use in a variety of situations and completely without notice of others (PMR is less portable). 6. Avoid imagery with psychotic patients, who might confuse reality with images.

ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 16 129 SPECIAL POPULATIONS CHAPTER  |  MODULE 17 Module 17: Adaptation of bCBT for Special Clinical Populations OBJECTIVES \u2022 To recognize cultural and diagnostic components associated with clinical populations \u2022 To understand clinical considerations of specific clinical populations \u2022 To learn how to adapt brief CBT for specific clinical populations Introduction Introduction Special clinical populations present unique life experiences, therefore requiring a therapeutic approach that understands this uniqueness and appreciates the context of the individual when engaging in clinical interventions. We describe four general clinical populations that may require more critical analysis of how best to apply brief CBT techniques. Military Populations Military personnel face unique and often intense physical and psychological challenges when serving their country.  A 2014 research article (JAMA Psychiatry, 2014) found that one in four active duty military personnel had signs indicating the presence of a mental health condition. Common mental health disorders in military populations include depression, anxiety, substance abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder. Individuals may also face physical health changes due to injury. Common somatic and emotional health symptoms may include chronic pain, insomnia, and anger management difficulties. Notably, somatic symptoms may be related to emotional health difficulties; and substance abuse issues may \u201cmask\u201d other mental health difficulties \u2013 especially those related to trauma. Finally, military personnel are at increased risk of suicide regardless of service era \u2013 but personnel from the recent Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts have been found to have high rates (20% or greater) of traumatic brain injury (TBI), which further elevates mental health difficulties and suicide risk. While on active duty, military personnel often face challenges that range from mild but chronic stressors (e.g. requiring to be \u201con guard\u201d while in combat environments regardless of actually being in conflict) to acute and severe stressors (e.g. physical injury or death or injury to a colleague or civilians). Although combat stressors are commonly associated with increased stress and mental health demands, other aspects of military life create challenges that may include post deployment reintegration into civilian life, social isolation, or possibly even severe non combat trauma such as military sexual assault. Regardless of the specific stressors or \u201ctriggering events,\u201d it is important to recognize that not all military personnel require mental health services.  ",

Regardless of the specific stressors or \u201ctriggering events,\u201d it is important to recognize that not all military personnel require mental health services.  However, many military personnel will face mental health challenges that do not reflect weakness on the part of the service member. These challenges must also be understood within the context of the service 130 member\u2019s home and/or social environment to fully appreciate the impact and potential sources of support to address any mental health conditions. THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS AND ADAPTATIONS Providers are encouraged to explore the meaning of military service and the possible relationship between military service, military-related stressors, and resiliency factors. Military culture may play a significant role in the way in which service members approach mental health treatment. For example, military culture places a premium on strength and resilience, which may be at odds with help-seeking behaviors. In some instances, emphasis on strength and resiliency may lead to social isolation and/or limited sharing of emotional or psychological struggles. Additionally, service members may face ramifications for seeking help that impact their careers such as pilots no longer being allowed to fly or security forces no longer being allowed to carry weapons. Stigma around seeking help can carry over for Veterans if they continue to work in national security positions as civilians or contractors. For all service members and Veterans, providers must attend to suicidal ideation and/or plans and should be prepared to actively manage these concerns using a comprehensive suicide assessment and safety plan (where needed). Importantly, this population tends to have greater access to firearms and lethal means than civilians. Providers should know their state laws for how to ensure lethal means safety for at risk groups. POTENTIAL BRIEF CBT ADAPTATIONS Providers may wish to consider the following adaptations to their traditional CBT approaches when working with military personnel and Veterans: 1. Integration of prior military experiences. For military personnel who strongly relate to their current and prior military service, providers are encouraged to explore the patient\u2019s military experiences for examples of challenges, coping, and successes. These examples may provide valuable information for treatment planning while also helping in understanding the patient\u2019s military context and developing rapport. 2. Peer support and social connection. Given the elevated potential for suicide, social isolation can be a critical contributing factor to the maintenance of emotional health difficulties. Many military personnel place a high value on service, family, and country.  ",

Peer support and social connection. Given the elevated potential for suicide, social isolation can be a critical contributing factor to the maintenance of emotional health difficulties. Many military personnel place a high value on service, family, and country.  Although they do not want to be a burden on others, they are often willing to consider the value of others in their lives and the need to connect (re-connect) through the encouragement of a planned therapeutic plan. 3. Romantic relationship status. Among military members, relationship problems are among the most common antecedents for suicide. Routinely monitoring relationship status is important and can signal any acute mental health status changes that may arise. 4. Attending to physical health and functional changes. Many military personnel will face physical and/or functional health changes that require lifestyle modifications. Many of these challenges push patients away from activities that previously brought them pleasure. Providers are encouraged to consider these prior activities (and the losses) the military member is now facing, and then identify new activities, SPECIAL POPULATIONS CHAPTER  |  MODULE 17 131 especially social activities, where possible, that remain available to the patient. For example, a patient who had been runner who is now no longer physically able to run may identify meaning in being outdoors, being with others during early morning runs, or feeling a sense of accomplishment. Although running is no longer possible, activities that are outdoors, involve others, and provide as sense of accomplishment are often possible. RESOURCES www.mentalhealth.va.gov Veterans Crisis Line 800 273 8255 Option #1 Older Adult Populations Older adults, particularly those ages 65 and up, represent a unique population that often face life circumstances and challenges related to work and retirement and changes in family dynamics or living arrangements, as well as increased attention to physical health conditions including changes in cognition and memory. These changes may include physical or functional changes but many individuals will face these challenges especially with advanced age. Older adults are at increased risk for social isolation and suicide, and these issues are further complicated when combined with a physical illness or changes in cognitive functioning (e.g. dementia). POTENTIAL ADAPTATIONS TO CBT FOR OLDER ADULT POPULATIONS 1. Speed and pace of therapy. Older adults, especially those new to psychotherapy, are likely to benefit from a pace of therapy that meets their emotional and cognitive needs. As a population, older adults vary greatly in their functional and cognitive abilities, and you must be prepared to adapt your approaches accordingly. ",

As a population, older adults vary greatly in their functional and cognitive abilities, and you must be prepared to adapt your approaches accordingly. Some older adults will require no modifications while others will need a pace and speed of therapy that are slower and use simplified language and intervention approaches. For example, some older adults may better identify and grasp the concepts of behavioral activation (e.g. pleasant events) versus more psychologically complex concepts, such as exposure or cognitive/thinking patterns that maintain behaviors. 2. Inclusion of caregivers and significant others. Although not appropriate for all older adults, the inclusion of caregivers may offer unique opportunities for providers to engage family or friends for at-risk older adults \u2013 especially those facing cognitive impairment, increased suicide risk, or social isolation. Caregivers may serve as passive supporters or as active members that facilitate treatment planning and/or between- session skill assignments. 3. Auditory or visual impairments. Providers are encouraged to assess for any auditory or visual needs when working with older adults. Specific needs may require alteration in telephone or other virtual platform delivery and may be important for written between-session assignments. SPECIAL POPULATIONS CHAPTER  |  MODULE 17 132 4. Cognitive impairments. Patients with cognitive impairments may benefit from simplified treatment plans and the incorporation of caregivers and/or significant others to facilitate treatment plans. See below for a specific section on cognitive impairment. Medically Ill Populations Patients that present with chronic medical diagnoses or with terminal sickness include a wide array of medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancers, HIV/ AIDS, and autoimmune disorders (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis). These vulnerable health populations often have comorbid mental health diagnoses or related symptomology. Individuals with chronic or long-term health conditions are two to three times more likely to present with mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression (Hudson & Moss-Morris, 2019). Due to the likelihood of acute changes in health care and status, use of brief CBT techniques is optimal to deal with specific and short-term distress concerns. POTENTIAL BRIEF CBT ADAPTATIONS Providers may consider the following when working with medically ill patients: 1. Prevalence of health-related distress. Experiencing acute distress in response to receiving medical diagnoses or sudden changes to health status are expected within this population. Providers should keep in mind that health-related distress may be the focus of much of the therapy. Patients\u2019 anxiety or depression may be symptoms of coping with their changing health status.

Providers may consider introducing behavioral activation activities that require low levels of physical involvement and cognitive restructuring around any thoughts related to negative views of the self or world in this new stage of life. 2. Need for flexible treatment delivery. The setting of the therapy will be dependent on patients\u2019 current health status. Providers may have to shift from their traditional office setting to treat patients that are in the hospital or cannot leave their home. Providers are encouraged to pay special attention to the patient\u2019s medical appointment schedule and allow for flexibility in the timing and amount of allowed session cancellations. Additionally, use of telehealth services becomes more important with this population and can increase the level of access to mental health treatment. 3. Between-session workload. Homework and in-between session practice are important to treatment success with CBT. However, providers should consider each patient\u2019s health status and use judgment in the amount and appropriateness of in-between session expectations. Talk with your patients about how feasible and/or likely it is they will be able to complete activities for that week. 4. Caregiver presence. Patients with severe health complications or dealing with functional impairments may require assistance from caregivers. Be mindful that caregivers may become integral in facilitating therapy for patients. Also, be aware that caregiver concerns and interpersonal issues between the patient and caregivers may be a central focus in therapy. SPECIAL POPULATIONS CHAPTER  |  MODULE 17 133 Populations with Cognitive Impairment More than 16 million people in the United States are living with cognitive impairment such as mild cognitive impairment disorder, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other dementias, and developmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Cognitive impairment can affect individuals of all age groups and impact an individual\u2019s memory, concentration, and decision-making. These difficulties can cause issues with processing information, ability to communicate effectively, and everyday functioning. Patients will have related mental health concerns stemming from their clinical diagnoses or related to distress of coping with functional changes.

POTENTIAL BRIEF CBT ADAPTATIONS Providers may consider the following when working with medically ill patients: 1. Timing and pace of therapy. Patients in this population may struggle with maintaining attention, processing information, or communicating their treatment needs. Consider a slower pace when communicating information and routinely checking in with patients to ensure they are keeping up with you during the session. Also, allow more time during the assessment phase to gain understanding of the patients\u2019 needs and to develop a treatment plan tailored to their clinical presentation. 2. Patient support. Providers should consider integrating caregivers, family members, or other support for these patients. These individuals will be liaisons between sessions, communicate information that the patient might have missed during the session, and help maintain treatment progress throughout the course of treatment. 3. Technique appropriateness. Consider the appropriateness of cognitive restructuring techniques for this population. These techniques are based on abstract themes and can be difficult for patients to understand, especially if cognitive impairment exists. Use aspects of patients\u2019 interests when describing examples of CBT and cognitive restructuring to aid in their understanding. If patients lack the capability to grasp this technique, focus your energy on behavioral activation or problem-solving techniques that are safe for patients to integrate into their schedule. SPECIAL POPULATIONS CHAPTER  |  MODULE 17 134 ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 18 Module 18: Ending Treatment and Maintaining Changes OBJECTIVES \u2022 To understand the process for preparing the patient for ending treatment \u2022 To learn techniques for preventing relapse What Is Ending Treatment, and Why Is It Important To Plan for It? End-of-treatment planning is the collaborative process of preparing the patients and assessing their readiness for ending treatment and moving beyond reliance on the provider to apply skills. Planning allows the patient to prepare for the end of treatment, to review skills learned in treatment, and to vocalize and problem-solve concerns about functioning outside treatment. All these factors reduce anxiety and allay fears a patient might have about ending a therapeutic relationship. When? (Indications/Contraindications) End-of-treatment planning begins at the first session when you give the patient some indication of the frequency and duration of treatment. End-of-treatment planning is an ongoing process, culminating in the final sessions with a review of treatment and introduction of relapse-prevention skills. ",

End-of-treatment planning is an ongoing process, culminating in the final sessions with a review of treatment and introduction of relapse-prevention skills. Patients with personality disorders or disorders of attachment may be particularly sensitive to feeling abandoned or upset as a result of ending the therapeutic relationship. For these patients, it is important to discuss treatment termination in an empowering and thoughtful way\u2014recognizing and normalizing their fears, assuring them safeguards are in place (e.g., emergency resources, booster sessions), and encouraging them via reminders that the purpose of CBT is self-management of symptoms. Measurement-based care used throughout treatment will inform an appropriate time for end-of-treatment. You can decide if additional sessions, a complete end-of-treatment, or booster sessions are needed depending on the type or intensity of symptoms the patient is still reporting. However, measurement-based care should be used in addition to ongoing conversations with the patient, your clinical judgment, and clinical requirements and procedures of the clinical facility. How? (Instructions/Handouts) REVIEWING WHAT WAS LEARNED The last session of brief CBT should be spent reviewing and recording the different cognitive and behavioral skills the patient has learned. Use Socratic questioning to elicit this list (\u201cWhat have you learned as a result of our time together? Is there anything that was particularly meaningful to you about your time in therapy?\u201d), as patients may generate skills or benefits of therapy not known to you. Patients should have a list of 135 these skills they can take with them. They should also be encouraged to keep the other handouts (e.g., Thought Records) completed during treatment as a reminder of their skills. RELAPSE PREVENTION Many patients are concerned that they will not be able to manage future psychological problems or psychosocial stressors without the aid of therapy. In planning for the end of treatment, you and patients anticipate potential stressors and symptoms and plan: 1) What tools the patients have learned in therapy that they could use for particular stressors/symptoms, and 2) when patients might need to contact a mental health professional for additional assistance (e.g., suicidal ideation). Preparing for inevitable difficulties is empowering and encouraging for patients. A functional assessment may be used to identify future problematic situations (see Module 4).

When I feel depressed for a month, I will schedule an appointment with my primary care physician/mental health provider. If my boyfriend breaks up with me, I will do a Thought Record to evaluate any unhelpful thoughts. TROUBLESHOOTING END OF TREATMENT Give Yourself Adequate Time to End Treatment. Plan on an entire session devoted to ending treatment, wrapping up, and maintaining changes. It is highly recommended that you not introduce new concepts during the final session, as new issues may arise; and ending treatment during the session may become impossible. GIVE THE PATIENT CREDIT Patients often attribute positive change to external entities and negative change to themselves. Therefore, at the end of treatment, discuss the patient\u2019s progress (using objective data, such as symptom-rating scales, when available), praise the patient, and emphasize the patient\u2019s role in positive changes. ESSENTIAL BRIEF CBT SKILLS  |  MODULE 18 136 RESPOND TO CONCERNS Checking in with the patient regularly about questions or concerns about ending treatment helps maintain the therapeutic relationship and offset negative emotions about treatment that could result in negative outcomes, such as feeling abandoned. If patients seem particularly concerned about ending treatment, they could use a Thought Record to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts associated with leaving therapy. PLAN SELF-MANAGEMENT TIME Patients may be interested in planning self-management time when preparing for the end of treatment. Self-management times are a few minutes each week that patients set aside, once therapy is complete, to check mood and use of skills and problem solve situations or feelings that may be negatively affecting their mood. These times last approximately 10-15 minutes and follow a structure similar to therapy. Self-management time is beneficial because it is free, can be conducted at and when and where it is convenient for the patient, and helps prevent relapse. A self-management worksheet (found at the end of this module) may be used during these times. BOOSTER SESSIONS Booster sessions can be scheduled approximately one month following the end of treatment and then as needed thereafter. During a booster session, you: \u2022 Check in with the patient about self-management of symptoms and stressors. \u2022 Refresh skills learned in therapy. \u2022 Discuss questions or concerns the patient might have about the transition.

What main points did we reach in our last session? What did you learn from last session? Did anything come to mind in the past week about our last session that you\u2019d like me to know or that you\u2019d like to discuss? 2. Were you uncomfortable about anything we talked about in our last session? Is there anything you wish we had discussed that we didn\u2019t? 3. How is your mood? Compared with last week, is it better or worse? 4. What treatment goals would you like to work on today? What problems would you like to put on the agenda? 5. What homework did you attempt or complete for last session? What did you learn from doing it? 144 APPENDIX A \u2022 PATIENT HANDOUTS Unhelpful Thinking Styles 1. All-or-Nothing Thinking: Viewing situations on one extreme or another instead of on a continuum. Ex. \u201cIf my child does bad things, it\u2019s because I am a bad parent.\u201d 2. Catastrophizing: Predicting only negative outcomes for the future. Ex. \u201cIf I fail my final, my life will be over.\u201d 3. Disqualifying or Discounting the Positive: Telling yourself that the good things that happen to you don\u2019t count. Ex. \u201cMy daughter told her friend that I was the best Dad in the world, but I\u2019m sure she was just being nice.\u201d 4. Emotional Reasoning: Feeling about something overrules facts to the contrary. Ex. \u201cEven though Steve is here at work late everyday, I know I work harder than anyone else at my job.\u201d 5. Labeling: Giving someone or something a label without finding out more about it/them. Ex. \u201cMy daughter would never do anything I disapproved of.\u201d 6. Magnification/Minimization: Emphasizing the negative or downplaying the positive of a situation. Ex. \u201cMy professor said he made some corrections on my paper, so I know I\u2019ll probably fail the class.\u201d 7. Mental Filter/Tunnel Vision: Placing all your attention on the negatives of a situation or seeing only the negatives of a situation. Ex. \u201cMy husband says he wished I was better at housekeeping, so I must be a lousy wife.\u201d 8. Mind Reading: Believing you know what others are thinking. Ex. \u201cMy house was dirty when my friends came over, so I know they think I\u2019m a slob.\u201d 9. Overgeneralization: Making an overall negative conclusion beyond the current situation. Ex. \u201cMy husband didn\u2019t kiss me when he came home this evening. Maybe he doesn\u2019t love me anymore.\u201d 10. ",

Personalization: Thinking the negative behavior of others has something to do with you. Ex. \u201cMy daughter has been pretty quiet today. I wonder what I did to upset her.\u201d 11. \u201cShould\u201d and \u201cMust\u201d Statements: Having a concrete idea of how people should behave. Ex. \u201cI should get all A\u2019s to be a good student.\u201d 145 APPENDIX A \u2022 PATIENT HANDOUTS Thought Record (1) Situation (2) Automatic Thought(s) (3) Emotion(s) & Mood (4) Evidence That Supports Thought (5) Evidence That Doesn\u2019t Support Thought (6) Alternative Thought (7) Rate Mood Now What actually happened?

Nondominant arm: Same as above. Forehead, lower cheeks and jaw: Lift eyebrows as high as possible, bite teeth together and pull corners of mouth tightly. Neck and throat: Pull chin down toward chest; at the same time, try to prevent it from actually touching the chest. Counterpose muscles in front part of neck against those in the back part of neck. Shoulders, chest, and upper back/abdomen: Take a deep breath and hold it. At the same time, pull the shoulder blades back and together, trying to make them touch. Try to keep your arms as relaxed as possible while tensing this muscle group. At the same time make stomach hard by pressing it out, as if someone were going to hit you in the stomach. Dominant leg: Lift foot off the floor, and push down on the chair with thigh. Nondominant leg: Same as above. 155 APPENDIX A \u2022 PATIENT HANDOUTS Deep-Breathing Technique Step #1: Put one hand on your abdomen, with the little finger about one inch above the navel, and place one hand on your chest. Step #2: Pay attention to your breathing (pause for several seconds to assess your breathing). Ideally, the hand on the abdomen should be moving, while the hand over the chest remains still. This ensures that the breaths are deep. Step #3: Take deeper breaths by getting the hand over the stomach to move, while having little movement of the hand over the chest. NOTE: If you have a lung or heart condition and you are having difficulty with this exercise, slow the process down to your comfort level. Step #4: Continue your slow, even, deep breaths. To pace yourself, you can say the words in and out slowly while taking breaths. Inhalations and exhalations should build to approximately three seconds in duration. Step #5: Repeat the breathing exercise three or more times. Other tips for deep breathing: 1. Inhale through your nose and out your mouth. 2. Purse your lips (as if blowing out hot soup) while exhaling. 3. Do not pause between inhales and exhales. 4. Close your eyes during the exercise. 5. Use a mantra such as \u201crelax\u201d during each exhale 6. Pair up deep breathing with imagery once you have mastered the breathing skills. 7.

TRANSCRIPT OF THERAPY SESSION Douglas Bower, Ph.D. It is our intention m include q demonstation tanscript each issue. The transcript for this issue is provided by Doug Bower who has availablc several sessions of dffirent therqpists and. clients. Doug explains this in his intoduction. The client and therapist gave permis:iot1 to publish the transcipt anonymously. They offer brief comments on the session. JDB The rcsearch project ftom which this transcript was taken was part of the requirements for a degree in pastoral counseLing. I wanted to know what client-centered therapy looked like ard to develop a sense of what it meant to do therapy. The purpose of the study was to accomplish the following subjective goals for myself: I ) To better understand the penon-centered theory of Carl Rogers; 2) To be able to articulate my understanding of thetheory; 3) To begin to develop expertise in theutilization ofthe person-cen- tered approach; and 4) To be able to draw implications from the person- centered theory for the ministry of pastoral counseling. Those therapists who were asked to panicipate had associated with Rogers, regarded them- selves as being penon- centered practitionen, and were recognized by others as advocates of the person-centered approach. We asked: 1) for a tape of a session which the therapist viewed as typical of his or her work; 2) for the therapist to complete a brief questionnaire; 3) that the client also fill out a brief questionnaire; and 4) that the client complete an abridged form of the Barrett Lrnnard Relation- ship Inventory. Six tapes were received witb the accompanying materials. That material was written up and the verbatim therapy transcript in this paper came from that study. Requests for reprints should be addressed lo the edilor. 78 Transc ipt of The rapy Ses sion TRANSCRIPT T =Therapist and C = Client Tl: I'm always nervous.I seem to get nervous that th\u20ac tape is sometling that I've got control of, you know, like its going to be my tape and I think I'm nervous about speaking into it because usually if it is someone else's then I'm less conscious of it or something you know.

This one part of the dream had a lot of complexities. It re3lly was odd and whal it was was this car which belongs to a man that I have been dating. I was like looking for it in the dream. And I couldn't frnd it. And so I thought well he wasn't around. And then all of a sudden I saw it. It was like in the brush, you know. It was definitely in sight. But it was as if it was parked so that it wouldn't be in sight. And, you know,I can see the tree limb hanging down and l'm real intrisued bv it. L . . It definitelv reminds of. . . the fact that this car doesn'thave head lights right now. You mean like they are gone. There are holes in there? No in reality it does but there's something wrong with the headlights. oh, oh. Something with the electrical system keeps them working at night They just don't tum on when you push the butlon. Yeah. when you push the button. Yeah. Which means that he can't drive at night so what he does is that somelimes he parks his car at the Seven-Eleven and leaves it there and he wouldn't necessarily be there you know. Let's say he came to visit me. He wouldn't necessarily be there. He left my place and went someplace else. The Seven-Eleven is like where he leaves his car and that way it can be watched because they stay open 24 hours. Well last evening after I left when we were all getdng together, I drove by the Seven-Eleven to see if his car was there beaause I was interested to know if he was in town. He is from Cleveland. And I drove by aad the car wasn't there and I remembered havingathoughtthatmaybehewassomewhereelse.And...ah...ormaybehedidn't even want me to know lhal he was in town. And I'm pretty sure that's what the dream has to do with. My concern that he doesn'r want me to know that he's around. Really I think it goes a little deeper than that. I should say that he doesn't want a relationship like I do. Well the thing was hiding. . . the carbeing hidden behind the tree symbolized him hiding it somewhere. Yeah.

I have to clarify that we have only known each other for two weeks, O.K. And its probably premature, but we spent a whole lot of lime with each other in the past week and a half and I was basically on cloud nine about the whole 79 T4: C4: T5: C5: T6: C6: T7: C7: T8: C8: T9: C9: Douglas Bower thing. And wewere talking about going camping togetler whichjust sounded like a geat idea- And he seemed to really be enjoying me and I was enjoying him and I was kind of wondering ge\u20ac when is the honeymoon going to end. But . . . feeling like I was ready to enjoy it as long as it lasted And then he reported to me that he had ulked to his mom and dad and they had inquired as to whether he had spent the night at my place or not and he told them that he had slept on the sofa which indeed he did. But then he was feelhg like he couldn't do that anymore. And I felt hurt a liftle bit at that. And I'm not sure . . . I'm not sure, . . . I'm a linle angry, where my anger is directed at. I'm a little confused . . as to whether it's at his parenls or at him. I think both. Um, probably the thing that that strikes me the most is thal he would allow his parents to make decisions for him. I feel like . . . if he genuinely inside feels like its wrong to spend the night, ifhe feels like he doesn't want to do that because he feels like it's not right, then I can really accept that. I can acrept and respect it either way, but that doesn't get me angry. It makes me feel a little disappointed or, you know, \"shucks I want you to stay wirh me. I wish you didn't feel that way.\"But I feel angrier with him I think because it seems to be tlle sinration where he doesn't de\u20acp down feel that way.

Um . . . he shared with me that he doesn't know where our relationship is going, whether or not we would be able to be married some day. And I had related to him a little earlier that (inaudible) and he kind of implied that he'd like the relationship to go in that direction and to just take it like where we're not concemed about whether or not we have a relationship in the fuhrre, but that we just experience each other in the now. And that's OK with me as lons as in the now we discuss the future (laughs). T16: Um-um. Cl6: Idon't.. Yeah. And I.. Solthink that's probably my . . .

When we met for a cup of coffee, hc told me tlat this conv\u20acrsation witb his mom came up and it set off an alarm inside of me. And I got anxious and concemed. And he's telling me that he's not going to be able to spend the night at all. It could have gone in many ways.

That was more this was more sonrething about her than about ihan about you. C26: Than about me. Yeah, I understood you. I've wondered about that . . . . Yeah! You know, probably, yeah, it was morc something about her. And I guess the alarm that it set offin me was \"Uh oh,\" because my last relationship like I said, this man was married to his mother and we went out for two years togetber and boiled down to he could not leave home. And, I just like refused to allow that to happen to me again a.nd um . . and, you know, this guy . . . Here's a situation where mayb\u20ac its not me. Because the last one wasn't me. But boy he couldn't leave mom. I mean he couldn't do certain things against mom. And one ofthe big things between Eddie and I is I'm Catholic and he's not. And despite the fact that he really admires and likes Catholicism and in some ways thinks that Catholicism is his religion, I met him at a Catholic club, a Catholic group, despite that his mom has real reservations about that. And um . . . he feels a strong pull to that and so I wanbd to clarify how he was feeling about me. I did take it as . . . as it was panly me. And . . . and se\u20ac this is tlp thing. It's so soon in the relationship that perhaps if we had gone out for a long time together, you know, he would have felt differently. But see that's what I'm so afmid I'm allowing to happen, we'll go out for a long time and in fact he won't want to stay with me - . T27: He won't . . . because of the mother thing again you mean . . . Yeah. C27: Yezh. Despite how much in love with me he becomes. And so I just feel the need to clarify that a lot. I mean John really loves me to death. And I know that, but I, you know, have pain about that because it doesn't matter how much he loves me. He cannot be with me. He will not be with me. ",

C32: But I think that he might be looking at this more in terms of not enjoying me for now, butthat I'm going to fall in love with him and he's not going to be here for me.

RESEARCHER'S COMMENTS . DOUGI.AS BOWER What I lzamed Conceming the Client The client had concems about a man she was dating. These concerns focused upon his relationship with his parents who forbid him from spending the night with the client. This in tum stirred up remembrances of a former rclationship with a man who was 'married to his mother\" and could not/would not conmit himself io the client. The client reported being bothered by the implications of her present relationship and her boy-friend's relationship to his parents. She felt \"hurt,\" \"confused,\" \"disappointed,\" \"cautious,\" and others. She laugbed and she cried. What I Leamed from the Therapist Conceming the Client I have believed that if the therapist empathiz\u20acs with the client, an observer should be able to learn something about the client from the therapist's responses. I looked at the therapist's responses to see if I could learn someth.ing. \"That botheB you . . . .\"\"You don't like to feel its good related to your parents to do things you really don't want to do . . . .\"\"You wanted to spend time with him and there \\vas no timc . . . . I found that I did not learn a whole lot from the therapist's responses. So much for thmry. ",

CTIENT Response to the conleflt: Itis intercsting to me that nearly nine years after this session I continue to be challenged by the theme presented in this session. I express frustration, hurt, aad anger with partners who make relationship detisions with an external rather dtan an intemal frame of reference. Although I suggest that, \"l don't operate like this,\" in relrospect I did. My goal was not to operate like thal. Nevertheless, two years after this session, I became involved in a four year relationship where both I and the other person connected largely because we possessed tbe suiable external qualities of the same religion, race, age, etc.: (that our parents found most Troruc ipt of The ropy Ses sion acceptable- external focus). Sincethis session, I have continued to evolve my internal focus, and therefore make decisions about my life that are much more consisrcnt with what I really value. At the tirne of this session, my desire to act on iniernal principle is evident, but the ability hadn't developed sufficiently to act on it, and I expected to \"get it from someone else\" . . . being disappointed in them when they didn't deliver it. Comments regarding the therapist: The therapist really seemed to care about me. I still recall my thoughts and my feelings, my beliefs and values were fully acceptable to the therapist. The therapist ofien seemed to be right on the edge of my awareness-very \"with me.\"(Responses T-3, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16,22,23,24,25,27 ,32,38,40,42,43,48). I recall feeling liked by the therapist, and ifthe memory vestiges serve me corlectly, after the session ended and I reflected back, I felt like it was truly OK to be me. In T-4 through T-8, the therapist was in@rested in my story. His rcmarks impressed me as a belief that my story was important to really get stmight. He took the derails seriously, as did I (This is important for dream worD, and I can remember thinking something like \"my story is imponant to him,\" and \"having an accurate understarding of my story is imponanr to him.\"",

T-18, it seems, missed and./or interrupted the point thar my experiences with men haven't been positive/productive wbere discussing the futurc is concemed, and T- l9 really divens away from my focus and may reflect the therapist's stereotypes or own personal issues (see T-29 also), or something, but not my experience. In T-20, he seems to be getting back on track with me. In hindsight, I can see that in C-20, I was, esp\u20accially toward tbe end, attempting to clarify how imponant it was for me to trust (be certain) that the man I arn courting possesses a clear internal frame of reference that I can depend upon. He knows himself, communicates that, and is trustwoflhy. Although I hardly think I was ready to abandon my desire to discuss the futue, I think whar I was getting at was that it was less imponant for me to \"talk about\" the future l}lan to have security that would come from knowing where this man really stood (and preferably on frm, intemally sound footing). Response T-26 appears to focus on interpreting Eddie 's behavior more than on my chagrin and confusion over Eddie's seeming changing attirude. The therapist's response does, however, accurately convey the content of Eddie's behavior which disturbs me...his concern about his mother's opinion. Despite the T-26 inrcrpretation, in C-26, I'm again forging out to convince myself of this striving to unleash the bind of the mother complex. Ijust want to mention response T-34 because I think that it is funny! In T-t14 tkough T-48, the therapist is seeking to capture not only the desire $at I Mve torealize my own decision with regard to Eddie, but to understand my struggle with acceptance of a man while also recognizing that he is unsuitable for me because he cannot provide me with what I want in a relationship. The therapist's words: \". . . any'thing they do can't be OK if it's affecting your life in some funny way.\"Final remark: My final response shows how I hoped to change Eddie to make him possess the requisite internal focus that would obliterate his insecurity and cause him to pursue me with his true desir\u20ac (of course this would be a double bind for him). During this session I believed perhaps he didn't love me enough. ",

For Eddie, religion may have been it. As for me, I can respect and accept his choice, but I am so glad to begin acting on my desires (seen here nearly nine years ago) to seek a deeply enriching self directed life wi$ a man who will too be self-directed, and to be patient enough and ready and courageous enough to wait to me\u20acl someone who desires growth, who is encouraged by my suppon ofhis growth, and who ca.n suppon me in my growth. Overall, I believe that my therapist acted with moderately high to high levels of empathy, and with very high levels ofgenuineness ard unconditional positive regard. 87 88 Douglas Bower COMMENTS - THERAPIST My primary observation after reading the transcript and commentary from the client is that therc is more to person-centered therapy than that which can be observed in a written uanscript of the verbal communication betweon client and therapist. I note that I said very little. I would probably say even less today. A number of the few things I said were determined to bo unimportant in content by the client during the interview or in her corunentary. Yet, tlle client repons that she felt understood and cared for to a significant degree. I suspect this could haye some irnplications for research and education. How important is the content of tbe therapisls verbal behavior in and of itself? For some reason, I found it interesting that in reading the transcdpt, I remembered word for word some of the things the client or I said and other things that I did not remember at all. Finally, I would like to mention a suggestion that I heard Carl Rogers make a number of times regardhg therapist's behavior: \"When in doubt, listen.\"COMMENTS . JEROTD D. BOZARTH The therapist's style is one of relatively low verbal responsiveness. The therapist is not interventive or intrusive. The client seems to respond affrmatiyely to the therapist's comments as well as to the relationship with the therapist. ",

The client seems to respond affrmatiyely to the therapist's comments as well as to the relationship with the therapist. The client's responses to the therapist nearly all affirm that the therapist has captured the essence of the communication. There does not appear to be any presumptions by the therapist and neither is the therapist worried about making something happen or encouraging the client to exploro any particular thing. It is, perhaps, an extreme example ofthe client doing the work and going in her own direction and pace. A couple ofissues raised for me are those of: ( I ) the imponance oftbe relationship which is not necessarily represented by verbal dia.logue by the therapist, and (2) the idea that it is not what the therapist does so mucb as what the theraDist does not do and the client does.

        "text": "24 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE Complete Transcript JOHN: Hi. I\u2019m John Sommers-Flanagan. RITA: And I\u2019m Rita Sommers-Flanagan. And we\u2019re really excited to welcome you to this DVD. JOHN: The DVD has clips from 11 different theory-based counseling sessions. On the one end, we begin with psychoanalytic theory, and on the other end, we finish with family systems approaches. And you know, Rita, one of the things I like the best about the DVD is that we feature real people with real problems. RITA: Mm-hmm. In fact, we involved six different professionals\u2014of course two of those are us. But four colleagues joined us, and like you said, it\u2019s real people with real problems. It\u2019s not scripted. JOHN: And not being scripted means that mistakes were made and that no one on the DVD is perfect. RITA: Right. And of course, we can\u2019t show you a whole theory in action. In fact, if you just dropped into a session somewhere in the United States at any time in any moment, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to tell what theory was involved in that session. In fact, I really like, John, how you\u2019ve explained that to some of the students. JOHN: Right. I think one thing that helps is to notice that each theoretical perspective has a different listening focus. RITA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: For example, if I\u2019m doing the psychoanalytic work, I\u2019m going to focus on different things while I\u2019m listening than if I\u2019m doing CBT or reality therapy. In addition, each theoretical model has different strategies and techniques that are linked to the model. And so in the DVD, we try to feature the listening focus as well as the strategies and techniques that go with each theoretical perspective. RITA: Right. The theoretical perspectives themselves have very basic beliefs that are different from each other, and, of course, result with different techniques and different strategies. But at the core, there are beliefs about the ways people change and the very essence of the 25 Psychotherapy.net meaning of life that drive the theories. And so sometimes you might see something going on that looks the same, but it\u2019s actually coming from a very different place. JOHN: Right. It\u2019s very complicated as you apply this to real situations. And we\u2019re both counselors, and we\u2019re dedicated to helping other counselors and psychotherapists become more effective in their work. And yet, I have to say, even in the process of doing this DVD, I felt humbled numerous times. And I felt that I continually learned. I learned from watching you do your sessions and from watching the other counselors and psychotherapists. I even learned from watching myself, which, as you know if you have done some video recording of yourself doing counseling or psychotherapy, it can be excruciatingly painful. But it\u2019s a great way to learn and develop your counselling and psychotherapy skills. ",

But it\u2019s a great way to learn and develop your counselling and psychotherapy skills. RITA: And we realize that this might be very bad news for some of you who are still in graduate school, working on gaining your basic skills. And you have that fantasy that you will graduate, you\u2019ll get your license, and you\u2019ll be the perfect counselor. JOHN: It\u2019s really a lifelong journey, and we hope that this DVD helps you become a more effective counselor a or psychotherapist. RITA: This session is an example of psychoanalytic or psychodynamic therapy. JOHN: If i were to say one thing about the psychoanalytic perspective, it would be repetition\u2014repetition of patterns. Whether you\u2019re operating from the old fashioned Freudian perspective or the more modern attachment theory perspective, both of those perspectives emphasize that individuals develop an internal working model based on early childhood interactions. And that that model dictates, to some extent, that repeating pattern of the way people have relationships as well as certain kinds of conflicts or intrapsychic problems that are manifest over and over. RITA: Mm-hmm. And psychoanalytic is a very long therapy process usually, so of course it\u2019s difficult to squeeze any of those concepts into a 20-minute session. John\u2019s listening with Sarah for repeated themes, 26 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE including the things she brings in, which is concern about blushing. JOHN: And what you\u2019ll probably notice is that the listening that I do is fairly unstructured. It\u2019s involving free association, or saying whatever comes to mind, which is one of the techniques that psychoanalytically-oriented therapists use. In addition, I will occasionally prompt her to explore the past to see if we can make some connections with how these particular problems, the blushing, first arose. RITA: Yeah. Your goal is to help Sarah begin to explore those repeated patterns in her life. JOHN: Absolutely. And as I do that, another thing to keep in mind is counter-transference, because counter-transference can distort the way I see Sarah\u2019s problems. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I think, from this perspective, it\u2019s so important to go slowly, to work collaboratively with clients so we can make sure that my reactions or my distortions of her problem aren\u2019t what\u2019s guiding the session, and it\u2019s really her issue and her problem. RITA: So let\u2019s watch a few minutes of John working with Sarah. ",

The words, I feel like, sound so harsh, but really I think of embarrassment, humiliation. I feel like I look stupid. Um, I\u2014 yeah. Those kinds of things. JOHN: Yeah. Pretty harsh things. SARAH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: If you go back in time, starting now, but just go way back, as early as you can, can you think of humiliation, embarrassment experiences where you maybe first started having that kind of flushing? SARAH: You know, it probably was when I was in college. And there were people that would say oh my gosh, your face just turned red. And I actually had someone that I worked with that would say to me, oh, I 27 Psychotherapy.net just love to embarrass you and watch your face turn red. And I can remember that I hadn\u2019t been that aware of it, but then there was just something that\u2014it just started, you know, the awareness, I think. It just started happening more and more often. JOHN: Yeah. Back in college\u2014it was an early time when you remember it. SARAH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: Can you remember a particular time when you flushed and what was going on then? SARAH: When I was in high school and the teacher would ask a question, I would feel fine answering a question and speaking up. And when I got to college, I wouldn\u2019t because I was afraid my face would turn red. JOHN: Mm-hmm. SARAH: So it\u2019s just that, that I would be in class and I would feel like I had something to contribute, but I didn\u2019t want to talk because I thought I would draw attention to myself with my face turning red, yeah. JOHN: What might you have said that would make your face turn red? SARAH: I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t really worried about the content, but I think that just talking in the group, it\u2019s just, I\u2014I knew it would turn red, and the idea of it turning red, and people thinking, gosh, look how insecure she is that she can\u2019t even talk without her face turning red. I just didn\u2019t want to deal with it, so I sort of quit talking in class. Yeah. JOHN: Mm-hmm. ",

Would that be right? 28 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE SARAH: Mm-hmm. Yeah. JOHN: And so now we\u2019ve moved to talking about some safety concerns about your children mostly, but just tragedy striking you. SARAH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And again, it seems like, maybe in some ways, the more and more you try to control your worry thoughts, the less they feel in control. It kind of feels like they keep getting bigger and bigger. Is that\u2014 SARAH: Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. They do. And I\u2014you know, I have periods of time where I don\u2019t feel this way, but\u2014but, yeah. I have a lot of thoughts of just wanting to live like a normal person and not having all these thoughts all the time in my head.

JOHN: Something that could be a tragedy. And the first thing you think of is the car accident sort of thing, and what else? What other kinds of tragedies or just even small bad things might happen? SARAH: I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t worry about small things, honestly. I mean, I don\u2019t. I feel like I\u2019m pretty good about that. I don\u2019t want\u2014yeah. I can categorize things.

Mm-hmm. JOHN: Yeah. And what kinds of things have you tried? SARAH: Well, I always think about whenever I\u2019m challenged with something, I always think about the worst-case scenario. And I believe completely that I can handle anything\u2014anything, and I\u2019ve gone through this whole list. Like if I lost my limbs or whatever,  I could handle anything.

And so I just come back to that, and\u2014 JOHN: And feel that underlying nervousness. SARAH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: Yeah. Yeah. And yet, if we go back to the blushing, that\u2019s not a bad thing happening. Speaking up in class? Not a bad thing happening. And yet that feels kind of out of control, too. SARAH: It does, because I really hate to be perceived as stupid. JOHN: Mmm. SARAH: Mm-hmm.

When I was younger, I had this persona that developed that I was an airhead, and I\u2019ve had to work so hard to kind of\u2014because I think I used it for a while to my advantage, and then in college again I had to work so hard to get rid of that whole image. And it still is kind of in there somewhere, I think. 30 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE JOHN: You still sort of have some fear of being perceived as an airhead.

I just, I really value intelligence, I guess. I value it a lot in other people. And I, I don\u2019t know. I just, I hate that I let myself have that persona for so long. It\u2019s just, it really bugs me. JOHN: Mm-hmm. SARAH: I feel like I could have done other things with my life if I hadn\u2019t gone without it so much. JOHN: Mm-hmm. What\u2019s going on to make that seem like a good thing then? SARAH: Oh, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I mean, people gave me attention and laughed, and I don\u2019t know. JOHN: What kinds of things did you do? SARAH: You know, I said some silly things like\u2014this is in seventh grade. But still when I see these people, they\u2019ll bring it up. JOHN: What did you say in seventh grade? SARAH: Oh gosh, really? JOHN: Ahh. SARAH:  There was something about a pen that had a calculator in it, and the battery died on the calc\u2014or the\u2014maybe it had a digital clock in it, and the battery died. And I didn\u2019t think the pen would work anymore because the battery died. And, uh, it was just a split moment thing, but everyone laughed and thought it was hilarious. And I think that\u2019s kind of when it started. And so people still, 30 years 31 Psychotherapy.net later, so, do you have a pen, Sarah? JOHN: Mm-hmm. SARAH: And I can laugh. I mean, I am totally fine laughing at myself. That\u2019s not the problem. It\u2019s just, I just don\u2019t want that identity that I\u2019m dumb. JOHN: Mm-hmm. And you kept it for a while. SARAH: Mm-hmm. Like a long time. JOHN: Yeah. What are some other examples of\u2014 SARAH: Mmm. Really? Another one that comes to mind is someone told me that their aunt had had a miscarriage, and I asked her if the baby was all right. JOHN: Uh huh. SARAH: So, you know? Because I just wasn\u2019t\u2014I knew\u2014I don\u2019t know what. That was just a dumb thing to say. I didn\u2019t mean to say that, and so that\u2019s another thing people bring up 30 years later.

SARAH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: Rita, while I was watching the clip of Sarah, one thing that I noticed was that kind of repeating or recycling pattern where, initially when she was asked about the blushing, she went back to a college experience. Later, she goes back to a high school experience, and later she goes back to a seventh grade experience. 32 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE And what that reminds me of is how maybe resistance has diminished over time. Maybe trust is built. Either way, it seems like from this model, you look at things in the past. You uncover different perspectives each time. RITA: Yeah. One thing I noticed during this session is you asked her what she had done before, which can kind of sound behavioral, actually. JOHN: Right. It might also sound solution-focused. But the reason for asking that is to really sort of glimpse or study her pattern of trying to resolve the problem herself, because that\u2019s important to the psychodynamics. And you know, in addition, I felt the impulse at one point. Like maybe I should have asked her, what do you think I think of you, which would be a question that\u2019s very psychoanalytic, because it kind of pulls for the transference that might be happening in the session between Sarah and me. RITA: Which maybe would have worked, or maybe would have been a little early for that kind of reflection. JOHN: Absolutely. RITA: Yeah. So the next clip picks up right where we left off. JOHN: Exactly. So let\u2019s watch. JOHN: But it\u2019s even many more embarrassing that you kind of took on that identity. SARAH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: Or did you take it on, people put it on you? SARAH: I think people put it on me after that, and then I went with it after that. Those are the two things that I really remember saying that were the worst. And then after that, I just kinda went with it. JOHN: Mm-hmm. And did you ever intentionally say things that were\u2014 SARAH: Oh, probably.

SARAH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: How about even before seventh grade? Anything where you felt like you were perceived as stupid? SARAH: Nuh uh. No. I was\u2014actually, I was pretty smart. JOHN: Uh huh. SARAH: Really. So, no. It was kind of a middle school thing. JOHN: Mm-hmm. And somehow you carry on this sort of remnant from middle school that people might see you as stupid.

JOHN: \u2014thought of I\u2019ll be caught\u2014maybe I\u2019ll be caught looking stupid. SARAH: Mm-hmm. Yup. JOHN: Mm-hmm. And the theme with your children is maybe I\u2019ll be caught unprepared, maybe tragedy will strike because I\u2019m not prepared? SARAH: Well, when you say that, it makes me think that, yeah, what if I\u2014what if I wasn\u2019t worried? Would that make the odds go up that something could happen? JOHN: What if I wasn\u2019t worried about tragedy? What if I wasn\u2019t worried about being viewed as stupid or unprepared? SARAH: Well, when I\u2019m thinking about the tragedy part, I mean, what if I let that go and I just, it wasn\u2019t on my mind all the time?

It sounds ridiculous when I say, but\u2014 JOHN: Yeah, yeah. But you hear this sort of belief in your mind\u2014 maybe worrying about the tragedy helps prevent it. SARAH: Mm-hmm. Yep.

I mean, it feels so\u2014it sounds so illogical, but that\u2019s how it feels right now.

JOHN: You\u2019ll not only protect them from tragedy, but you\u2019ll protect them from their perception of you worrying too much. SARAH: Right. Right. JOHN: You know, Rita, as I watched myself working with Sarah, one thing I noticed is I didn\u2019t really do any formal interpretations. And really what I was doing was prompting her to look at her past, trying to notice what patterns might come up. And I think in a lot of ways, that might be more appropriate than jumping in there with deeper interpretations. RITA: Right, especially at this stage. But the interesting thing is I think Sarah actually had some insight. And you could kind of feel that in the tape as you watched. JOHN: Right RITA: Yeah. JOHN: She was working away. And I did notice that toward the end, Rita\u2014 RITA: The mother came up. JOHN: And Freud would be very happy that that occurred. RITA: Yeah. In historic analytic work, all roads lead to the mother. JOHN: But in reality, we know that it\u2019s not just the mother, it\u2019s the mother and the father\u2014the caretakers, other significant people in the person\u2019s life\u2014that somehow shaped that internal working model that 38 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE eventually causes some issues or difficulties to repeat themselves. And I guess in closing, I just would like to say that Sarah was a fabulous client, and that I think she has the potential for lots of insight that might help her work through some of the issues that she presented in the session.

JOHN: If I were to say just one thing about Adlerian therapy, it would be that it\u2019s highly practical. And I think that might be one of the reasons why so many contemporary theories have borrowed and stolen from Adler, often without even giving him any credit. RITA: Right. JOHN: Adlerian therapy is also seen as a precursor to modern cognitive therapy. And one of the reasons for that is because of Adler\u2019s concept called the Style of Life, or lifestyle. And that concept really is about how an individual develops beliefs about himself for herself, about others, and about the world. And that those beliefs guide the person as the person has to deal with different tasks of life. And so that\u2019s very similar to the cognitive perspective of the schema. And so that\u2019s one of the ways that Adler really was foreshadowing cognitive theory in therapy. RITA: That\u2019s right. You know, Adlerian therapists are always very interested and very involved. They have an educational approach, which is oriented toward helping clients begin to understand what Adlerians call basic mistakes. JOHN: In the upcoming clip, one of the things that I\u2019m doing is a family constellation interview\u2014that\u2019s the main focus. And sometimes I worry a little bit, in the session with Clayton, that I stuck a little too close to the clipboard and missed some chances to interact with him a little bit more spontaneously. But I did notice that a lot of those birth order characteristics that Adler talked about so much come out in the session, and so let\u2019s watch.

You know, and I noticed that you were using an educational approach. In fact, I think our friend B. F. Skinner may have actually been invited into the room. JOHN: Now, I never actually said the word Skinner, but, you know, my justification for that is that both Adler and Skinner would agree that punishment is generally an ineffective strategy, both in families and in life. RITA: In this next clip, you say something paradoxical, kind of, that people can watch for. JOHN: Right. And I also try my best to keep Clayton awake and engaged. RITA: Which can be challenging.

CLAYTON: Get me back. JOHN: Exactly. And so then what do you do? CLAYTON: Dodge it. JOHN: Just dodge it and he falls over, just like you did that one time, right. CLAYTON: JOHN: And so it\u2019s sort of a trick. And that\u2019s exactly, I think, what\u2019s going on with you and Carter, is it he annoys you. Right? He goes like this. Is that annoying? Huh? 55 Psychotherapy.net CLAYTON: Kind of. JOHN: Am I being annoying? CLAYTON: Yes. JOHN: And then what do you? CLAYTON: Get him back. JOHN: Yes. You want to get him back. But he\u2014the problem is he want you to get him back, because you are\u2014 CLAYTON: Bigger. JOHN: No. CLAYTON: Older. JOHN: Sort of. RITA: So John, in that last session, I noticed that you used the hand-pushing technique, which was interesting. It\u2019s not necessarily Adlerian. JOHN: Right, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s really\u2014I really was wanting to keep Clayton awake and engaged and involved, and I do think that Adlerian theory is very open to using all kinds of different strategies to help people glimpse different ways of acting and thinking in life.

And Adlerian therapists often use very provocative and interesting interventions. Sometimes they name them sort of provocative names, like spitting in the soup. JOHN: Right, which is a little bit gross. So let\u2019s not talk about that anymore. But instead, I would say that the Adlerian use of those provocative techniques is designed to enhance insight, which Adler believed then insight would enhance motivation toward positive changes. RITA: Mm-hmm. And I also wanted to note that Adlerians will often involve the parent or the caretaker of a child when you\u2019re working 56 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE with a child Clayton\u2019s age.

JOHN: Right, which is a little bit gross. So let\u2019s not talk about that anymore. But instead, I would say that the Adlerian use of those provocative techniques is designed to enhance insight, which Adler believed then insight would enhance motivation toward positive changes. RITA: Mm-hmm. And I also wanted to note that Adlerians will often involve the parent or the caretaker of a child when you\u2019re working 56 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE with a child Clayton\u2019s age. JOHN: Right. And another shout-out or positive thing about Adlerian approaches is that the Adlerians were really some of the first to emphasize doing parent consultations as a means of helping improve family life and children\u2019s behaviors. RITA: And even though we didn\u2019t see a parent in this particular clip, I really think Adlerian is a great choice for a kid like Clayton, and can make a real difference. JOHN: This session is an example of the existential approach, and it features a colleague of ours, Dr. Nilda Soto Bishop. If I were to try to boil down the existential perspective into a sentence or so, I\u2019d say it focuses on meaning. And so the listening focus for the counselor or psychotherapist is on listening for what\u2019s important or meaningful to the individual client. RITA: Right. I also think it\u2019s about self-awareness and consciousness. JOHN: And it\u2019s about living life fully, embracing life fully, even in the face of death and other ultimate existential concerns. RITA: Including aging, which has a big one for some of us. Peggy, who\u2019s featured in this clip, is a 62-year-old graduate student, so obviously some of these issues are real for her. JOHN: And Nilda helps Peggy focus on some doubts and some concerns, as well as being genuine and spontaneous in the session. Another thing is that she also tries to develop an I-Thou relationship, and I think that\u2019s consistent with existential theory\u2014I-Thou relationship being a deep respect and honoring of the other person, and yet, at the same time, being genuine and spontaneous. RITA: Mm-hmm So let\u2019s watch Nilda and Peggy at work. BISHOP: Where do you want to go with this session? What do you feel like you could benefit most from talking about this section? PEGGY: Well, you know that picture of the big jar and\u2014it\u2019s Stephen Covey, I think. And you fill it with the big rocks, and then you say, is the jar full? And then say, oh, yes, the jar is full. And then he says, well, no, wait. Look, you can put all this gravel\u2014 57 Psychotherapy.net BISHOP: Gravel in. PEGGY: \u2014in it. Yeah. BISHOP: Yes. PEGGY: And then is it full? Oh, yeah, well, no. You can put the sand in and then put water in it. And then what\u2019s the lesson? ",

But the lesson is, really, that those big rocks have to go in first. So I\u2019ve been thinking about that a lot\u2014to know what the big rocks are and make sure they\u2019re in the jar. And so my family, and work, and school, and my spiritual life are all in the jar. And I guess I would say that in these last few weeks, I just feel like those four rocks are jockeying for position\u2014 BISHOP: In the jar. PEGGY: \u2014in the jar, yeah. BISHOP: OK. They\u2019re jockeying for position in that jar. But they all fit in the jar. PEGGY: They\u2019re in the jar, right. BISHOP: They\u2019re in the jar and they fit. PEGGY: Yeah. BISHOP: So tell me what position do they need to be in in that jar? PEGGY: Well\u2014 BISHOP: What do they\u2014 PEGGY: I actually would like to throw the work rock out of the jar. BISHOP: Oh, really? PEGGY: Yeah. I feel just\u2014I feel frustrated at work, like it\u2019s just, I\u2019m in the wrong place. It\u2019s taking up too much time for the amount of reward. All of the reward is just financial, and I am ready to say\u2014you know, they always say follow your passion. And the money, well\u2014 BISHOP: Yes. Money is not your passion. PEGGY: And that seems completely unrealistic, especially toward the 58 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE end of life, when you\u2019re supposed to be thinking of putting stuff away. But when I think, so I should just do this for another 10 years and retire, it just makes me feel like screaming and tearing out my hair. I can\u2019t do it. BISHOP: Wow. PEGGY: I physically can\u2019t do it. I have to do something else. BISHOP: Something different has to come. PEGGY: Yeah. It takes such a big chunk of life. You know, I\u2019d like to say\u2014in fact, I do say to my husband\u2014why don\u2019t you just think about this and see how you feel?

PEGGY: For a while, I could sort of agree with him. It sort of is. I\u2019m just doing it for fun. But the more I\u2019m in the program, the more I sort of like fish or cut bait. You\u2019re either going to be invested in it, or else you\u2019re just, you know, like\u2014I don\u2019t know. You just wanted a diploma on your wall. That would be an expensive hobby.

I remember being at my daughter\u2019s volleyball game when she was in junior high, and during a break the coach came over and was talking to some of us sitting on the bleachers. And in the middle of this conversation\u2014which is always kind of difficult for me. I never can think of what to say. And I thought, ahh, he thinks I\u2019m a grown-up. It was like, . Because I was a mom of a teenage kid, but inside, uh, no. That just wasn\u2019t going to go. BISHOP: Well, OK. It begs the question\u2014tell me what being a grown- up means to you then. What is that? What is grown-up? PEGGY: Well, just that sense, I guess, that you could to make decisions about your own life, that you weren\u2019t just waiting for people to tell you what came next.

PEGGY: But in every other area, it was really like, ah\u2014that sense of not being able to ask for things. That was always pretty strong. In fact, it just seems like recently, since I\u2019ve been coming to counseling, that I\u2019ve had that feeling like, boy, I could ask for things that I want. And I think even in kind of little practical ways, like, to say, you know, I know you feel on uneasy around my kids, but do you think you could just come stay with them for an afternoon? Even something like that, where, nah, I don\u2019t want to do that. And so somethings that I really want\u2014like this. I really, really want to go to school. And I am actually saying to my husband, I really want 60 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE to do this. And he\u2014and my son, too. They go, are you sure? Do you really see yourself doing this? Because it was sort of be pushing out into where I haven\u2019t really been before.

Why wouldn\u2019t I? BISHOP: That questioner. There\u2019s always that question of there. And it\u2019s not just a questioner\u2014kind of a doubter. PEGGY: Mm-hmm.

They\u2019re going to send you to the principal\u2019s office every day during art so that you can learn to type, or they\u2019re going to push you out of this grade into the next grade to leave all your friends behind and meet a lot of people who think you have no business being there, or whatever that thing is. Don\u2019t stick out. And so it just makes you kind of want to not rock the boat. BISHOP: So I\u2019m wondering\u2014I\u2019m just wondering this. It makes me curious about whether there\u2019s part of that gifted sixth-grade you that knows, knows that if you keep being gifted and you keep being outstanding, eventually someone\u2019s going to ask something of you you cannot accomplish, and then you\u2019re busted. 61 Psychotherapy.net PEGGY: No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like that at all.

RITA: Nilda tries an explanation that Peggy says no to in this session, which I really liked. I liked how that worked. I could feel Peggy\u2019s strength in the relationship, and Nilda rolled with it. It was, yeah, that\u2019s fine. JOHN: You know, I think that flows from the existential concept of presence and sort of being present in the room. And Nilda is able to be accepting of Peggy having a different perspective than her, which is a really valuable thing. I also really like the moment in the session where Peggy says, you want more, you want more. Because I think it was exciting and fun, but also it\u2019s a preview of what\u2019s coming next. RITA: So let\u2019s watch for Nilda and Peggy working on some of those existential issues of delight and excitement.

And now you\u2019ve moved into a different place because at a certain point, those kids are now going to be doing something different. And they\u2019re 62 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE on their own path. PEGGY: Pretty much, yeah. BISHOP: Yeah.

And sometimes I thought if I had known it was going to take me 20 years to get married, I would go back, do that part, and be an engineer of some kind\u2014either an industrial or civil engineering and design things and build things. But I thought at the time I wasn\u2019t very good at math, and I thought, I\u2019m going to have kids. That was like, my goal. And I got that goal. BISHOP: Mm-hmm. PEGGY: And, you know, I was telling you before that sometimes I thought, boy, doing that just chopped a hole in the middle of my life, and now I\u2019ll never get to do these things I\u2019m really starting to love, because I took 20 years of my life and was out of the workforce. But I\u2019m not sorry I did that. That was what I wanted to do. And I did it, and it pushed me harder than\u2014 BISHOP: It was your choice. PEGGY: Yeah. BISHOP: You made that very deliberate choice. PEGGY: If I had birthed those kids, that would have been a different picture\u2014a whole different picture. But as it was, they needed me. I 66 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE needed them. It was a good symbiotic relationship. BISHOP: Mm-hmm. PEGGY: And I think it\u2019s put me on the path to where I am now. I think it\u2019s brought things out of me that I didn\u2019t know I had\u2014when I didn\u2019t feel like a grown-up, when I felt like I have to hide from every scary thing. I could not hide from their scary things because they were my kids. BISHOP: PEGGY: So that was a different way of approaching life than I had had before. ",

BISHOP: I\u2019m kind of struck as you talk about that\u2014the word that kind of stayed with me in all of that. Concept\u2019s stay with me, but the word that stayed with me through that is this symbiotic, because it seems a really important part of your life.

JOHN: Rita, in that proceeding segment, I really like the part where they\u2019re using the metaphor. And Peggy talks about really feeding 67 Psychotherapy.net herself, feeding herself with school, with something that gives her delight, and obviously a very positive in her life. RITA: Yeah. Yeah. And, of course, as professors, how could you not love that she pats her stomach and says, it feels as good as cheesecake. JOHN: It even tastes better than cheesecake. And I think this is consistent with what Kurt Schneider, who\u2019s a famous existential writer, talks about when he says embracing the awe of life\u2014kind of rediscovering the awe or the excitement, the deep excitement, of life. RITA: Yeah. Obviously for Peggy in her stage of life and her issues, existential work is a great avenue for her.

JOHN: In this next session, one of my favorite counselors, RITA, is doing person-centered therapy with a man named Michael. And I\u2019d like to start by saying in 1942, Carl Rogers said\u2014he made a bold claim\u2014he said that personality change and positive therapy outcomes will occur, can occur, based completely on the development and establishment in therapy of a certain type of relationship between client and therapist. RITA: I\u2019m really quite complimented that you said I was one of your favorites. I thought for sure you were going to say Carl Rogers, because he\u2019s one of your heroes. Anyway, so one of the things that Rogers said is that it\u2019s both necessary to have those core conditions and sufficient, which, at the time, was controversial, and probably still is. JOHN: Yeah. And the core conditions are not microskills, even though it is important to do active listening when you\u2019re doing person-centered counseling. RITA: Right. JOHN: But the core conditions are attitudes\u2014attitudes that the counselor or psychotherapist holds while in the room with the client. And those core conditions or attitudes are congruence, or genuineness, unconditional, positive, regard, or sort of amped-up respect, and empathy, or empathic understanding. RITA: Yeah. And for Rogers, I think the idea was, in those conditions, with the work together, there would be the emergence. of the self. 68 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE And one of the things he said was absolutely essential with something he called contact, which is that connection in the room between the person and the counselor. JOHN: And we\u2019ll see as this next segment begins Michael comes in and he\u2019s talking about Crohn\u2019s disease, and his medical diagnostic journey. And that the point where we pick up the session, Rita is listening, and he\u2019s talking about some stress that he has experienced in his life. RITA: Yeah. Let\u2019s watch. MICHAEL: I wanted to changed my life so that I didn\u2019t have so much stress in my life. I was an independent consultant. I worked, you know, 80 hours, 90 hours a week consistently for seven, eight years. You know, I didn\u2019t get to see my children kind of thing, even though I worked in the home. And it was kind of like, I\u2019d fall asleep at my desk, wake up and keep working\u2014that kind of feeling. ",

MICHAEL: You know, I\u2019m trying to reduce that in my life, for or, as my wife says, try to create barriers so that you say\u2014you can say no. And I have a hard time saying no. RITA: Yeah. So saying no is hard. So your wife, who knows you well, is saying, OK, Michael, maybe you can build a barrier that would allow you to say no. MICHAEL: Right. Right. And, you know, and then of course I have my family in there\u2014of course very helpful, but they have lots of needs, as well. They have their own internal issues going on, and they have me in the middle trying to help mediate their issues. RITA: You mean larger family, not just your kids. MICHAEL: Yeah, larger family. Family origin. And so it\u2019s\u2014they have 69 Psychotherapy.net issues within themselves. RITA: Sure. MICHAEL: But I\u2019m the rational one. I can help them. And so I\u2019m their sounding boards on both sides. We\u2019re having issues. Can you help me deal with that? RITA: Wow. Yeah. MICHAEL: And how do you say no? Well, I don\u2019t know, and I try, but it\u2019s difficult. And but it causes me a lot of stress. It causes me a lot stress because I don\u2019t want to take a side for somebody. RITA: Right.

I try to create a mantra, right, where I\u2019m like, just be thankful for what you can do, not continue wishing what you could do or remember what you used to be able to do.

MICHAEL: Right. Right. RITA: And I\u2019m hearing a little fear. MICHAEL: Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Because I mean, it just comes back to\u2014I mean, for me, anyway, I have issues with even my masculinity sometimes. And so then to have a disease that makes you feel like you can\u2019t do all the things you used to be able to do, it all of a sudden is\u2014you\u2019re already a face. You know, I already have relatives that tell me, well, you just need to toughen up. I was like, well, I would like to, but the intestines say no. And that\u2019s not one of those things that are very comfortable to talk about, either. Again, it\u2019s kind of like, when you have cancer, you say, I have cancer. And it kind of trumps all, right?

JOHN: As I was watching you, Rita, with Michael, I couldn\u2019t help but 74 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE notice that Michael was talking a lot. And that\u2019s great. It\u2019s really, really good to have a client that\u2019s verbal and talking a lot. But I also thought to myself, huh, that makes it even, maybe, a little harder. RITA: It\u2019s a little trickier.

Like, it\u2019s like, that\u2019s so interesting. RITA: Yeah. MICHAEL: I\u2019m like, I guess. 75 Psychotherapy.net RITA: Yeah. Interesting, yeah. But I notice a lot of times when you tell me about what\u2019s going on inside of you, I\u2019m hearing this internal scolding pattern.

What are you complaining about? MICHAEL: Right.  It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s like this quit-feeling-sorry- for-yourself feeling. Maybe it was the way I was raised. I don\u2019t know. Because, I mean, I didn\u2019t\u2014it wasn\u2019t like I was\u2014I mean, of course I\u2019ve had a lot of blessings in my life that I feel so thankful for. And so I really think about that a lot\u2014thinking about, gosh. And I\u2019ve always had that problem growing up, thinking, gosh, I have been given so much in my life. And it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t had my share of issues, obviously. But I just feel like I\u2019ve been given so many things. You know? I was adopted. ",

I could have been left on this doorstep where I would have most likely died. RITA: Right. MICHAEL: But I was brought here, and I got to live this amazing life, so what do I have to complain about? So that\u2019s what kind of goes through my\u2014that\u2019s the dialog that goes through my head, like, yeah, I\u2019ve had this bad thing happen, but, you know, it could\u2019ve been worse. It could\u2019ve been, you know, whatever. I could\u2019ve lost my arms or I could\u2019ve\u2014I could be dead. You know, so I kind of go to those extremes, sometimes. I\u2019m sitting there on the couch, it\u2019s dark. The dogs are sleeping or snoring. And I\u2019m just sitting there like, OK. One more hour. I can make it. I can make it. You know, in those times, I\u2019m like, OK, I can feel sorry for myself for a little while, because no one\u2019s awake. No one\u2019s depending on me. Nobody\u2019s needing anything. And so it\u2019s that time. RITA: Mm-hmm. MICHAEL: You know? And, but then I\u2019m like, OK, it\u2019s going to be all right. And I can take another drug here, and I\u2019m going to be fine now, and I\u2019m going to feel good. And so\u2014 RITA: So even when you\u2019re feeling sorry for yourself in these really 76 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE private quiet times, part of the message you\u2019re giving yourself is, the drugs\u2014it\u2019ll be better in a little while. So it\u2019s not that all the way down to just why is this happening to me? MICHAEL: No. And that\u2019s the part that I\u2019m a little afraid of doing, honestly. I am. I\u2019m afraid of going to that level. Like, because, in some ways in my mind, I think, gosh, you\u2019re just whining, or you\u2019re just complaining, you know, and I don\u2019t complain. RITA: So that inner\u2014we\u2019ll call him Mr. Type A. But that inner thing is not letting you face into the despair side of this. Boy, you just get scolded right back away from that. MICHAEL: Yeah. Pretty quick. I mean, I\u2019ll get there, and I\u2019ll feel bad. I\u2019ll even\u2014I mean, I can\u2019t even weep about it, at times. Because I\u2019m just like, no, it\u2019s not.

But she\u2019s like, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. But it makes me feel bad. RITA: So this goes all the way back to parental messages of get up there and take a lot of room in the world. And what I\u2019m hearing is you really don\u2019t know how much space you should take up in the world. MICHAEL: Right. RITA: You just don\u2019t know. MICHAEL: Right. And that\u2019s the part I don\u2019t\u2014which is fascinating, because my alter ego in front of the classroom is I can be as big as I want\u2014not in a bad way. And I mean, one of the things\u2014and, you know, I always think, for me, since I love teaching so much, I think about it all the time. It gives me a lot of life. And I think about just my own theories on how I teach\u2014because I was never taught formally. I mean, I wasn\u2019t like\u2014I didn\u2019t go to 77 Psychotherapy.net education school. I wish I would have. RITA: Right. MICHAEL: And I was like, but I\u2019ve made up my own theories on just common sense, in my mind, but just creating this atmosphere of community, creating this atmosphere of respect between your students, and not where they feel like they\u2019re able to run you over, but where we can have a true dialog, and have this conversation. RITA: Right. MICHAEL: But I feel like I can just do whatever I want to in that arena. And\u2014 RITA: Right. That\u2019s where you\u2019re at home. MICHAEL: Yeah, absolutely.

And it was the one thing that was helping me take my mind off of the things that were hurting me during all that time. RITA: Yeah. That\u2019s the flow or the muse or whatever. You\u2019re there. MICHAEL: So my stomach or my digestion\u2014all of that was just distraught and just all this pain. But I\u2019d get in front of the classroom, and just for that hour, it could just go away, unless it was really bad. RITA: Sure. MICHAEL: But I could even figure out ways to accommodate myself. I\u2019d go to the restroom before class, and be like, OK, no, I\u2019m good for a while. But it\u2019s just like, it\u2019s like my mind could just disappear for a while, and I could just let it go. And even all my little things that bother me, they\u2019re let go, just for that. And I imagine that\u2019s exactly\u2014 and you say muse, that\u2019s exactly what I imagine artists and painters. 78 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE That\u2019s where they get.

And so when I bring it back in week 15, they\u2019re like, oh my gosh, you remember that? I\u2019m like, see? You realize that it\u2019s all connected. Everything\u2019s all connected. Maybe it\u2019s Buddhist or something. And I just think, but it\u2019s so true. Even in the world of computer science, everything\u2019s so connected, and that\u2019s really an interesting thing. That\u2019s what I love about it so much. And, you know? I don\u2019t know. RITA: So one of your questions is really could that me that\u2019s found this home, this peace, this balance, could that me be in other parts of my life? MICHAEL: Yes. Yes. RITA: Could I bring this over and find that balance, that peace, the story? MICHAEL: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Because, I mean, even when I exercise\u2014not as much now, because, of course, I just can\u2019t, physically, but before, I had a hard time just going out for a bike ride to enjoy the weather, enjoy the scenery. I was thinking how much time? Can I do it faster? Can I go a little bit faster? Can I push myself a little harder? RITA: Right. MICHAEL: I\u2019m like, what happened to just going out and enjoying the 79 Psychotherapy.net ride? You know? And I berate myself a little bit over that, and be just like, gosh, why can\u2019t you just go out and ride just to ride? And in some ways, I\u2019m really thankful, because now I truly am thankful. RITA: Now that question is for real. Yeah. MICHAEL: Yeah. I just made it. Thankfully, I just made it through. You know? And so that is a different feeling. That has been very fascinating. JOHN: From the perspective of person-centered theory, one of the things that Rogers probably would say about Michael\u2014but maybe about all clients and all people\u2014is that he\u2019s suffering from conditions of worth that are placed upon him or have been placed upon him about who he is and how he functions in the world.

RITA: Mm-hmm. I really was very moved by the actual description of Michael in his struggle to just ride his bike and just enjoy it\u2014not time himself, not push himself. And that\u2019s a real struggle for anyone, but clearly is a metaphor for Michael as he tries to integrate his medical condition with other things in his life that matter. JOHN: It\u2019s also a great general example of the importance of letting the real self be in and experience the world. RITA: Right. It was a great session with Michael, and I think he\u2019s the kind of client that works well in the permissive environment of a person-centered approach. This next session is an example of a Gestalt approach. JOHN: Fritz Perls once said, \u201cwake up and come to your senses.\u201d RITA: Gestalt is a very physical, very sensory-oriented, and it\u2019s about being in the now\u2014being aware of what\u2019s happening in the body. JOHN: And really so then what the therapist or the counselor or psychotherapist is watching for and listening for in the session are things that are happening in the now, emotion, and flashes of insight that might be happening. RITA: Which is sort of interesting, because it\u2019s sort of lots of parts that come together in the work, in Gestalt work, and it\u2019s all about integration. Gestalt is really about the whole, about integration. 80 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE JOHN: Now, in this upcoming segment, I\u2019m working with Sydney, and it really represents Gestalt therapy accurately in the sense that it\u2019s a little bit spontaneous and unplanned. He starts by telling a dream that he\u2019d had the night before, and from the dream, we shift into the empty chair technique, which is a classic Gestalt technique. RITA: That\u2019s right. One thing that\u2019s true about Gestalt work is it\u2019s not necessarily planned. Let\u2019s watch as John works with Sydney with some of these techniques. SYDNEY: And at the same time, I think there\u2019s an element of either perfectionism or something like that, that when I experience those moments, or I think I do, that it may get a little blown up in terms of its magnitude, or overgeneralized in some way. So it can be\u2014and that\u2019s why, I guess, laughter feels like the appropriate response, as I wrestle with those disparities in some point. ",

JOHN: I want us to try something, if it\u2019s OK. And one of the things in Gestalt therapy is that we do things we call experiments. SYDNEY: OK. JOHN: And so if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m actually going to get out of this chair and we\u2019re going to do a thing that we call the empty chair technique. SYDNEY: OK. JOHN: And I\u2019ll move back. And I hear two sort of distinct parts in there, one part being anxiety. And so I\u2019d like you to put anxiety in this chair. SYDNEY: OK. JOHN: And have you, in that chair\u2014and you have a conversation with the anxiety in more of an active way. SYDNEY: OK. OK. 81 Psychotherapy.net JOHN: Does that make sense? SYDNEY: I think so. JOHN: If at any point you have questions, let me know, and I\u2019ll sit back here and I\u2019ll make some comments as you talk to your anxiety. SYDNEY: OK. JOHN: OK? SYDNEY: OK. So anything I want to say to my anxiety. JOHN: Anything you want to say to it is a place to start. SYDNEY: OK. JOHN: And then the anxiety will get a chance to speak as well. SYDNEY: OK. JOHN: OK. SYDNEY: OK. JOHN: All right? So I\u2019m slipping back here. And so we put the anxiety right here. SYDNEY: OK. JOHN: And\u2014or here. SYDNEY: OK. JOHN: And you just tell the anxiety what you would like it to know. SYDNEY: OK. I guess I would like you to know that I\u2019m not always clear and sure as to why you show up and as to what your function is, if there is a useful function. I think sometimes a little bit of you might be fine, but a lot of you is not fine, and is counterproductive in a way. JOHN: Kind of like, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here sometimes.

What 82 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE do you have to say to Sydney, who\u2019s now in that chair? SYDNEY: Well, Sydney, I guess I would say that I\u2019m here to make sure that you do what you\u2019re supposed to do and that you stay on track, and that you have some negative feeling, which is me, associated with behaviors that don\u2019t fit with your values. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m here, is to remind you of when your behavior doesn\u2019t fit well with your values. [JOHN gestures for Sydney to move back to his original chair to respond to his anxiety. Sydney moves back to his original chair.] SYDNEY: Well, I would respond to that by saying, you have a good point. At the same time, you can be a little excessive sometimes. It\u2019s good for me to have reminders that encourage me to be motivated to align with what I believe and my values, at the same time, sometimes you reach a point to where that isn\u2019t helpful anymore, where there\u2019s too much of you in the picture. [JOHN gestures for Sydney to move to the chair and respond as his anxiety. Sydney moves back to his original chair.] SYDNEY: OK. So, that is an interesting point. And I could see how too much of me could be debilitating\u2014too much of anxiety, of me, could be debilitating. And so perhaps\u2014yeah. You have a good point. I\u2019m not sure what else to say about that. Part of me wants to say I will temper myself down a little bit or tone it down a little bit so that I\u2019m not so in-your-face at times when maybe you need just a little bit of me, as you\u2019ve made clear. So part of me wants to say that, that I\u2019ll temper it a little bit. JOHN: OK. Let\u2019s go back to Sydney and just talk a couple minutes, or maybe just a few seconds, and then I want to guide you through another little piece of this. SYDNEY: OK.

SYDNEY: I think the first thing that comes up is seeing\u2014or feeling, not just seeing\u2014but I guess this feeling level of feeling like this anxiety is just another part of me that I, Sydney, have some measure of control over, that perhaps I sometimes forget or I\u2019m not aware of\u2014that this 83 Psychotherapy.net is a part of me that sometimes I want to push away and say it\u2019s an external thing that\u2019s acting on my life in a way that has a negative impact sometimes. And through this empty chair activity, it feels as if\u2014verbalizing from the standpoint of anxiety makes me feel like it\u2019s just a part of me, and like other parts of me, I have some self-determination in how it shows up, to what degree, and see the utility of that voice within certain boundaries, I guess and limitations. JOHN: OK. So what I\u2019d like you to do is to talk again to the anxiety. Begin by saying, thank you, anxiety. I hear you wanting to be helpful. SYDNEY: OK. JOHN: And then maybe ask the anxiety, are you worried that I might not live up to my own values? SYDNEY: OK. JOHN: And so just try to\u2014again, find your own words, I guess, for that. SYDNEY: OK. JOHN: But that kind of message. And then go over and be the anxiety. SYDNEY: OK. OK. So, anxiety, I appreciate your concern for me and wanting to make sure that I live in alignment with my values. And I thank you for that, for keeping me on track in that regard. And I also hear that you\u2019re concerned that without doing that, or without a certain degree of that, that I will slip in some way.

And so thank you for sharing that with me, as this discussion helps me figure out how much of me is the right amount, how much is too much and is unhelpful. 84 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE JOHN: Mm-hmm. So while you\u2019re in the anxiety chair\u2014anxiety, I heard Sydney saying to you that he appreciates you. SYDNEY: Mm-hmm. JOHN: He values you. SYDNEY: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And thanked you. And what does that feel like to you, to anxiety? SYDNEY: To anxiety? JOHN: What\u2019s it feel like? SYDNEY: I think I kind of smile, I guess, because I feel like perhaps I\u2019ve been told by Sydney that you shouldn\u2019t be here. You should be gone, abolished from existence in some way. So that\u2019s the first thing that comes up. JOHN: In some ways it feels validating? SYDNEY: Yeah, like it\u2019s OK for me to be here as part of you, as part of your life, in a way. JOHN: Yeah. You have a purpose. You have a function. SYDNEY: I have a purpose and a function, yes, as opposed to being in this tug-of-war, in a way, where Sydney\u2019s always trying to kick me out. JOHN: Mm-hmm. JOHN: As we were watching the preceding segment, Rita, it reminded me of how important it is for Gestalt therapists to not interpret, even so sometimes there\u2019s a tug in that direction. RITA: Oh, yeah. JOHN: And I felt like I might want to tell Sydney what I thought of some of the things that he was doing and saying\u2014what it might mean. And so I was as a little proud of myself for holding back and directing, which is the role of the Gestalt therapist, as opposed to interpreting. Because it\u2019s really Sydney\u2019s experience to interpret. RITA: It\u2019s true, although, of course, therapists always make some kind of decision. And I noticed that you went with anxiety, and you didn\u2019t 85 Psychotherapy.net go with shame\u2014things he mentioned. JOHN: Right. And, you know, I don\u2019t even remember making that decision. RITA: Yeah. JOHN: But actually, in retrospect, I feel better about going with anxiety. I think that would be easier than to try to do both at once or to go with shame first. RITA: Yeah. ",

JOHN: You know, another thing that happened is that I had Sydney\u2014I had him talk to his anxiety, and I\u2019m just curious about what you thought of that. RITA: Well, I liked it. It\u2019s a great technique, and I think the empty chair and the talking is always very interesting. I don\u2019t think Sydney went super deep and we really heard the voice of his anxiety. We heard Sydney, as anxiety. But still, I thought it was pretty helpful, yeah. JOHN: Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. And Sydney is really very good at sort of taking on the voice of those different entities inside himself. RITA: Yeah. And in this next section, we\u2019re going to watch some dream work, where you ask Sydney to take on the voice of the different parts of the dream, which\u2014classic Gestalt, isn\u2019t it? JOHN: And it\u2019s not easy often for clients to do that, and so watch to see how Sydney does it. JOHN: One thing we didn\u2019t do with the dream, because you went through it speaking first person. But what you didn\u2019t do was we didn\u2019t give you a chance to try on some of the entities in the dream. SYDNEY: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And so what I\u2019d like you to do now if you\u2019re OK with it is to go back through the dream, and I\u2019ll just prompt you to put on the different entities, and to be the different parts of the dream.

And as you say those words, does that connect with anything for you? SYDNEY: I think it connects with moments that I experience\u2014 heavy, burdened. Unwieldy, not so much, but heavy and burdened. And I would say not in the big picture of my life, but right now it\u2019s near the end of the semester.

I\u2019m a little bit\u2014a little bit murky. My clarity is not that good to come full circle to clarity. It\u2019s a little murky. I have a lot of different features.

I\u2019m diverse. I\u2019m diverse and dynamic and changing. JOHN: What\u2019s it feel to say that? SYDNEY: It feels\u2014the first thing that it feels is this connection with what I just mentioned about anticipating the next two weeks to be busy. The first thing that I felt was sort of this connection with how rivers change with the season\u2014how the snow melts and they come up and they flow big and swollen, and lack of clarity. They\u2019re murky. You can\u2019t see as well. And they\u2019re more brown, and more debris is floating down as the runoff collects all of those things. JOHN: There\u2019s so much going on that it\u2019s murky. SYDNEY: Yeah. JOHN: Yeah. SYDNEY: And then as the season progresses, the water level starts to lower. It becomes more tranquil, calmer.

He\u2019s not telling me what to do in a way that makes sense, that is clear. So to speak from that perspective of that paddler, I\u2019m confused. I\u2019m frightened. I have the tools that I need, such as this paddle, in my hand, but I don\u2019t have the internal tools, such as the knowledge and skill that I need.

This next session is an example of behavior therapy, and it features a colleague of ours from the University of Montana, a counselor named Selena Beaumont Hill, who\u2019s a member of the Crow Tribe here in Montana. Now, behavior therapy is all about learning theory\u2014or learning theories is probably a better way to express it. But the focus is often on what are the rewards or the reinforcers that create and maintain behavior, and what are the consequences or the punishments that tend to diminish or reduce the rate of behavior. RITA: Mm-hmm. And, you know, behavioral therapy is excellent for people in positions like Selena\u2019s to work with people who need to make significant changes in their behavior, and to make those rather quickly. JOHN: Now, Selena\u2019s working with Brittany. Brittany has flunked out of college. She\u2019s working on getting reinstated. And one thing I like about the beginning of the session is that Selena is working on just sort of casually discussing\u2014maybe not casually, but discussing the natural incentives that are associated with Brittany wanting to be or staying in school. RITA: Right, and some of the maladaptive behaviors that are probably playing a role in her having flunked out. So\u2014 JOHN: Absolutely. So let\u2019s watch. RITA: Let\u2019s watch. HILL: And I really just want you to describe some of the patterns, some of the behaviors, some of the things that you were doing that led to the suspension. 91 Psychotherapy.net BRITTANY: Right.

And because it\u2019s like an option to not go\u2014like sometimes I\u2019m just really tired. And it\u2019s hard, too, because like the schedule\u2019s so different. Because like, with high school, I had to be there at 7:45 every morning. It was always the same. But like now it\u2019s like, Tuesday mornings I can like, sleep in, but like, Wednesday mornings and Monday mornings, I have to get up early. And I don\u2019t know.

HILL: Just because you have\u2014you know, you don\u2019t have anybody saying, you have to be home at midnight, or you have to get up to go to school at 8:00. You know? Nobody\u2019s checking on you, and it\u2019s the first time you\u2019re just out being independent and making those decisions.

HILL: The Sha- Shama- Shamanism\u2014 BRITTANY: Shamanism. Yeah. HILL: \u2014class, how was that class for you? BRITTANY: You know, it\u2019s interesting, but like, I don\u2019t know. Not exactly what I want to study. And again, it was like something that was free that fit in my schedule. But I don\u2019t know, like\u2014I don\u2019t love the professor, and I mean, I\u2019m not\u2014I don\u2019t want to be a Shaman, you 95 Psychotherapy.net know? HILL: Mm-hmm. BRITTANY: And I mean, those are both kind of like religious studies courses, and that\u2019s not really my thing, so. HILL: OK. All right. JOHN: I noticed Selena doing some nice focusing or psychoeducation on the nature of maladaptive behaviors, and that\u2019s really an important thing to focus on when you\u2019re working with, I think, a young woman who\u2019s struggled in college. RITA: Right. And I thought it was interesting to see her have Brittany talk about a typical day, and kind of start identifying those contingencies, and what was going wrong. ",

It\u2019s also classic that Brittany was in an upper classman class, and a class on Shamanism. And combine that with lack of good habits, or maybe some bad habits. JOHN: Selena also, in the upcoming segment, works on contracting, which is another behavioral approach, as well as behavioral problem- solving\u2014in other words, how can Brittany use some skills to use new and different behaviors and new contingencies to change her behavior in a positive direction? RITA: Let\u2019s watch how that works. HILL: OK. So, as part of the reinstatement process, you have to agree to do some of these things. So it\u2019s really important that you understand all\u2014because this is basically a contract that helps you, that keeps you on track for what you should be doing in the fall, to help you be a successful student. BRITTANY: OK. So I can for sure come back in the fall? HILL: Actually, not for sure yet. BRITTANY: OK. HILL: What I\u2019ll do is go through this plan with you, and then after that, we\u2019ll call over to the dean\u2019s office, get you an appointment with them. And they actually do the reinstatement. They\u2019re the ones that decide. 96 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE BRITTANY: OK. HILL: So remember in the beginning I said it\u2019s important that you\u2019re really honest with me about everything. BRITTANY: OK. HILL: And the dean will ask the same, because what we want to do is make sure that you\u2019re ready to be back in school, and that this is the, first of all, the right university for you and the right time for you to be here. BRITTANY: Yeah. HILL: And it\u2019s not about keeping out of school or not about not wanting to encourage. It\u2019s just about making sure it\u2019s the right thing for you right now. BRITTANY: Right, yeah. HILL: It\u2019s not a\u2014I guess it\u2019s not a form of punishment, but it\u2019s definitely a process to make sure that you\u2019re ready to be here. BRITTANY: OK.

It\u2019s probably the biggest problem. HILL: OK. And so what\u2014and I know you talked about the social, being social with your friends and staying out late. Was there anything else that kept you from going to class? BRITTANY: So, yeah. Just sleeping in, and, I don\u2019t know. I guess like, they don\u2019t take attendance all the time, and I didn\u2019t really think it was that big of a deal. Like, I mean, I don\u2019t always miss class, so I just\u2014I guess I didn\u2019t think it was that big of a deal. And, I mean, sometimes it\u2019s boring, and I\u2019d rather do something else. Like when it\u2019s nice out, 97 Psychotherapy.net I don\u2019t want to go to that class, where I\u2019m like, already not doing that well. HILL: OK. Going to class is very important, and I know it\u2019s pretty easy not to do that. You\u2019ve already talked about some of the obstacles that have\u2014or the things that have prevented you from going to class.

BRITTANY: Yeah. HILL: So and I want to come up with things that will work for you, not things that I think will work, but things that you can do. BRITTANY: Right. HILL: So maybe just thinking back to high school and the times where you did have your parents\u2019s guidance on getting to school and the importance of that.

BRITTANY: So maybe if I like, kind of got a pattern going so that it was easier. It\u2019s just so hard. HILL: OK. And that\u2014we can definitely try to build a schedule that meets that needs. What are maybe a couple other things that would help you make it to class regularly? BRITTANY: Um, well, not staying up as late would be helpful. HILL: OK. BRITTANY: It\u2019s just hard, because I\u2019m not really tired. Like, I\u2019ll 98 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE look at the clock, and I\u2019ll see it\u2019s like 11:30, midnight, but, I mean, it feels like it\u2019s like 8:30 or 9:00. So I don\u2019t know\u2014maybe telling my roommate. Because like, she\u2019s often like, the person that wants me to go to the University Center and get ice cream or like, watch a movie with her. And like, I\u2019d like to, but it\u2019s kind of like a sleepover every night. So maybe I could just like tell her that I can\u2019t stay up late all the time. HILL: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. OK. So getting up at the same time each day, falling into that pattern, but also not staying up as late, which is also a sleep pattern. BRITTANY: Yeah. HILL: So it sounds like a lot of this is around you getting rest, and that is very important. So what are just some natural\u2014just some things that you would do to make sure that you went to bed early? Because nobody else is\u2014you know, I\u2019m not going to be there in your dorm at 9 o\u2019clock at night or 10 o\u2019clock at night, reminding you, oh, remember our agreement.

Because it kind of sneaks up on me sometimes, that it\u2019s so late. And like, I\u2019ve been taking a lot of naps. That\u2019s the other problem.

BRITTANY: So maybe like, just, like I could even like not take a nap once, then maybe I\u2019d get in the right pattern, you know? HILL: So you\u2019ve talked about patterns a lot, so that sounds like it\u2019s a pretty\u2014that\u2019s what helps you function, is finding a pattern, finding a daily schedule. BRITTANY: Yeah, I guess that is kind of what it is. 99 Psychotherapy.net HILL: Mmm. And that\u2019s human nature. I think we all work better if we kind of know what to expect and how to set a schedule up for ourselves. BRITTANY: Right. HILL: I know for me I have to have a to-do list each day at work, because I could be on email all day. But if I have a to-do list to follow, then that helps keep me organized for the day.

But it\u2019s also important that if you\u2019re able to achieve these that you reward yourself. BRITTANY: Mm-hmm. HILL: And sometimes it\u2019s something simple like going out for ice 100 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE cream with your friend when she asks you to. Other times it\u2019s maybe something bigger\u2014going out and buying yourself a pair of shoes or something. BRITTANY: Right. HILL: What maybe are some possible rewards that you could give yourself if you were able to follow this pattern that we talked about? BRITTANY: Um, well, maybe like me and my friends could go like, camping. We live like, pretty close to some good areas for that, so maybe we could go camping like at the end of the semester.

A camping trip sounds like it would be very rewarding, and kind of that ultimate what\u2019s keeping you motivated. BRITTANY: Mm-hmm.

What\u2019s maybe something you could do to reward yourself? BRITTANY: Maybe\u2014well, me and my roommate like to like, marathon TV shows. So maybe we could like, watch an episode on the days I go to class. HILL: Nice. Yes. That\u2019s a great idea. BRITTANY: But not too late. HILL: So build that into your weekly schedule.

And that will probably take you a while to get\u2014because your body is now used to, you know, kind of having these late nights, late mornings. BRITTANY: Right. HILL: And so to readjust to all of that will take you some time.

I think it\u2019s really helpful, too, if you look at maybe some little consequences that you can give yourself if you miss a class. BRITTANY: Yeah. HILL: One example you used for a reward is watching one of your TV shows with your roommate. So maybe missing a class means you don\u2019t watch the TV show with your roommate. What are maybe some of those smaller consequences you can give yourself? BRITTANY: Ugh, like going to the library. HILL: Ooh. BRITTANY: Like, maybe I would have to make myself go to the library for the amount of time that I was supposed to be in class. HILL: That is a great\u2014 BRITTANY: That would not be fun. 102 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE HILL: Going to the library. Let\u2019s\u2014maybe two more of those types of consequences. BRITTANY: So like, not watching the episode of whatever TV show. HILL: OK. BRITTANY: And I don\u2019t know, maybe like scaling back of my weekend plans. HILL: OK. BRITTANY: Like taking one commitment out of the weekend that was something social I wanted to do. HILL: OK.

HILL: Just to keep you on track with your plan of getting into a pattern in your schedule, one of the things I want you to do is a self- monitoring assignment\u2014nothing that\u2019s going to take a lot of time, just mainly keeping track of when you\u2019re going to bed at night and things like that so you can see what pattern you are in now. And so try to find those times of night that will give you enough time to get a full night\u2019s rest. BRITTANY: OK. HILL: So let me give you this schedule. I\u2019m going to give you this worksheet here. And you can just keep track of your bedtimes and what your schedule\u2019s like. And then you can also start\u2014I\u2019m going to give you a note pad, and you can also start logging down, from here on out, when you\u2019re going to bed and what not.

HILL: So you\u2019ll know by the time you\u2019re done meeting with her. BRITTANY: OK. All right. 104 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE RITA: So John, that\u2019s a great case for a focus on rewards and contingencies\u2014very clearly applicable to Brittany\u2019s situation. JOHN: Absolutely, yeah. And I liked Selena using the self-monitoring assignment toward the end of the video segment, probably because the research is really good that self-monitoring is a nice assessment, from the behavioral perspective, but also it\u2019s an intervention in and of itself. RITA: Right. And there\u2019s that little consequence of having to go talk to a dean. So I really think this is a great demonstration of behavioral therapy and how it can make a big difference for people like Brittany. This session is an example of cognitive-behavioral therapy with John, who is, actually, also one of my favorite therapists, working with a client name Meredith. JOHN: Thank you so much. RITA: You\u2019re welcome. JOHN: CBT, as it\u2019s popularly called in the literature, is similar to behavior therapy in that it focuses on learning theories with the real specific focus in the session being what are the maladaptive or irrational cognitions and what are the maladaptive or unhelpful behaviors that the client is engaging in. RITA: Right. And when you work within the realm of cognitive or cognitive-behavioral, it can be a very gentle, very collaborative process\u2014sort of like Aaron Beck. JOHN: And I like that approach, but also it could be a little more abrasive and forceful, like Albert Ellis\u2019s rational-emotive behavior therapy, and his tendency to dispute or to use disputation to push people out of their irrational thinking. RITA: So in this session that we\u2019re about to watch, John uses a very standard cognitive-behavioral opening, and he make a problem list. JOHN: And in this particular segment, we don\u2019t see Meredith list any more problems than the first one, because that\u2019s the one we chose to work on.

RITA: So in this session that we\u2019re about to watch, John uses a very standard cognitive-behavioral opening, and he make a problem list. JOHN: And in this particular segment, we don\u2019t see Meredith list any more problems than the first one, because that\u2019s the one we chose to work on. RITA: He also uses the classics three-column cognitive-behavioral technique, working with the problem of shyness that she\u2019s 105 Psychotherapy.net experiencing. JOHN: All right. So let\u2019s take a look. RITA: OK. JOHN: Well, Meredith, we know each other, but the way we usually start a CBT session is to set an agenda. MEREDITH: OK. JOHN: And so we might have several ideas about what we want on the agenda, but the first thing is usually for us to make a problem list together about whatever it that you might want to work on. MEREDITH: OK. JOHN: And then we\u2019ll do the problem list, and then we\u2019ll explore the thoughts and the behaviors that might be related to the problem. And hopefully by the end of our time together, we\u2019ll have a clear idea about what\u2019s causing the problem and some ideas about how to maybe change things. MEREDITH: Sounds good. JOHN: All right. MEREDITH: So, one thing that I\u2019ve been noticing lately is that I have a tendency to kind of hang back in groups, and I tend to observe instead of participate. JOHN: OK. MEREDITH: And, a lot of times, I get really nervous when I feel like I\u2019m expected to speak up. And I want to speak up, but I kind of feel like I freeze. JOHN: OK. And so in particular then, in groups, the setting is big groups, little groups? Does it matter? MEREDITH: It doesn\u2019t matter a whole lot, but generally, I guess, medium-size\u2014like, you know, in classes that I have. They\u2019re usually like maybe 12 people or so. So relatively small, medium. I don\u2019t know what size that is. JOHN: OK. And so but in your head, you probably would say, I would 106 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE like to speak up, but, for some reason, you feel inside some anxiety or nervousness about that. MEREDITH: Definitely. JOHN: OK. MEREDITH: And then sometimes when I try to force myself to speak up when I actually don\u2019t feel ready, I get like, I feel like my throat\u2019s closing, and I get a red face. JOHN: OK. All right. So that\u2019s sort of one possible issue for issue for us to talk about. Could you maybe give me a specific example of a particular group situation, as recent as you can, where you had this feeling of hanging back and maybe some fear of evaluation. MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. ",

So in my statistics class, each week we have a\u2014it\u2019s called an inclusion activity. And generally, I guess, that\u2019s supposed to help people feel like the group\u2019s more cohesive and included. But I usually experience it as the opposite. So there\u2019s usually a task at the beginning of each class of, like, take off your shoe and talk about the most interesting place your shoe has been. Stuff like that. JOHN: In stats. MEREDITH: Yeah. That\u2014usually I get really nervous, and I feel like I can\u2019t think of anything to say. And I feel like I usually end up saying something really awkward or lame, and I just don\u2019t feel good about it. Like, I feel\u2014 JOHN: Yeah. Can you give me that specific example of the recent time when maybe\u2014and what you said, too, including sort of the beginning, what happened, and then how it ended. MEREDITH: Yeah. So when we did this activity\u2014 it\u2019s like a really weird example. JOHN: Yeah. All right. MEREDITH: When we did this activity, probably six or seven people had gone in front of me, and I was like, not listening to anything that anyone else was saying, just total self-absorbed in terms of like, oh 107 Psychotherapy.net God, what am I going to say, and not being able to think of anything. And then when it was my turn, I was wearing a pair of shoes that like, are, kind of like, they have lace on them. And so I took it off and I said, I like these shoes because I get cool tan lines from them. So I didn\u2019t even really answer the question that was like, where have these shoes been, or like the coolest place these shoes have been, or something like that. JOHN: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. MEREDITH: And then after I went, I didn\u2019t really listen to anything else anyone said, because I was still like, stuck on why didn\u2019t I answer the question? And just kind of feeling awkward. JOHN: OK. So what I\u2019m doing here is I\u2019ve got several columns that I\u2019m building. And the first one is you\u2019re in the stats class, and you\u2019re going through and inclusion activity. ",

JOHN: What thoughts are going through your mind. And the thoughts are, oh God, what am I going to saying? Those are the early thoughts. And then maybe later thoughts are, why didn\u2019t I even answer the question? MEREDITH: Yeah. And like, why can\u2019t I ever be articulate? JOHN: OK. Why can\u2019t I ever be articulate? OK. And then our third column are the emotions that you might be feeling. And so as you\u2019re in that situation and people are taking their turn\u2014the teacher says, you\u2019re doing the inclusion activity. People are taking their turns. And what are you feeling? How would you describe your emotional state? MEREDITH: Mmm. Nervous. JOHN: Mm-hmm. MEREDITH: Yeah. Like, fearful. JOHN: OK. MEREDITH: And, like, it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m anticipating embarrassment. 108 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE JOHN: Mm-hmm. MEREDITH: So I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a feeling or not, but usually I feel embarrassed. JOHN: I put that in the thought column. MEREDITH: OK. JOHN: Just because it seems like the anticipation of it is probably a thought, but embarrassment, when you\u2019re in the middle of it, is probably a feeling. MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: Does that make sense? MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And then so I got nervous, fearful, embarrassed as the emotions. And on a scale of zero, not at all, 100 being the most of that feeling you could ever have, how would you rate\u2014let\u2019s get rid of nervous, because it\u2019s sort of covered by fearful. How would you rate fearful and how would you rate embarrassed? MEREDITH: Mmm, maybe fearful like, a four. MEREDITH: OK. MEREDITH: Or a five. I don\u2019t know. JOHN: A 4 or a 5 out of 100? MEREDITH: Or I mean 45. JOHN: OK, I was going to say. Oh, feeling pretty calm. So a 40 or a 50. MEREDITH: Yeah. JOHN: OK. And embarrassed? MEREDITH: I\u2019d say that\u2019s higher. JOHN: A little higher. MEREDITH: Yeah, like a 70. JOHN: So maybe a 70. And that would be at the moment that you\u2019re talking, or right afterwards, or right before? Does it fluctuate at all? 109 Psychotherapy.net MEREDITH: Yeah. I\u2019d say like, both during and after. JOHN: Mm-hmm. OK. MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. ",

MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And so it seems to me like one of the things that\u2019s going on\u2014 oh God, what am I going to say, and why I didn\u2019t I answer? Why can I never be articulate? MEREDITH:  Why can\u2019t I never be articulate. That sounds exactly like\u2014 JOHN: Yeah. It\u2019s perfect. MEREDITH: JOHN: We might have to start rating my anxiety now, too. And then I guess there\u2019s the other thing. You said that you\u2019re anticipating embarrassment. And so are those words too also that are going through your head? MEREDITH: Yeah. Like, I wish I could be more clever or, I wish I could have just like a funny story right now or make people laugh in a way that I want them to laugh. JOHN: In the preceding segment, obviously Meredith is a very interesting young woman. And she talks a lot about some what might be considered irrational thoughts or maladaptive thoughts. In particular, we get to see a little glimpse of what she does that is black- white thinking or dichotomous thinking. RITA: Right. Right. And she comes along with the process, even though obviously she\u2019s even kind of shy in the session, and nervous. JOHN: Yeah. RITA: Yeah. So in the next section, we can watch as you focus more on that black and white thinking that\u2019s getting her in trouble. 110 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE JOHN: Right. And I also take a look at and try to point out helpful verses unhelpful thoughts. And I find that that\u2019s a good language to use with clients when you\u2019re using cognitive therapy, because they naturally kind of get a sense that, yeah, some thoughts are less helpful. Some thoughts are more helpful. And in the upcoming segment, I actually do that in the here and now. It happens in the room. I get a chance to point that out to Meredith. RITA: Great.

MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: OK? Kind of unhelpful thoughts. And then over here what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re coming up with some thoughts that might be more helpful. OK? MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: Recognizing that no thoughts are perfect, but some thoughts are more helpful. Some thoughts are less helpful. MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And you know in your stats class, you\u2019re going to do the inclusion activity\u2014 MEREDITH: Every week. JOHN: Every week. And so one possibility is you could come in prepared to shift your thinking from the less helpful to the more helpful. MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: Just an idea. MEREDITH: That\u2019s a good idea. JOHN: OK. So what else besides this is silly and what I say doesn\u2019t matter all that much? MEREDITH: Um, I can be clever sometimes. 111 Psychotherapy.net JOHN: I can be clever sometimes. Good. That\u2019s sort of a counter to the why can\u2019t I ever be articulate\u2014or why can\u2019t I never be articulate. MEREDITH: JOHN: Either way you say it. Well, let\u2019s pretend for a second that you were talking to a friend who had exactly this same scenario. And she was telling you the way that she talks to yourself\u2014oh God, what am I going to say? And why can\u2019t I answer that? Why can\u2019t I ever be articulate? I know I\u2019m going to embarrass myself. And so she\u2019s talking to herself that way. How would you talk to her? MEREDITH: I think that I\u2019d probably express surprise, because I imagine that usually I don\u2019t perceive her as inarticulate or as embarrassing as she sees himself. JOHN: OK. So you would be surprised and kind of reassuring to her, and say, oh, you don\u2019t seem that way. MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And if you could be on her shoulder in the situation, what would you whisper in her ear? MEREDITH: Hmm. JOHN: This is a good friend of yours. You want to be helpful.

MEREDITH: I mean, it sounds pretty ideal, but it sounds really far away from my current experience. JOHN: It\u2019s not what you\u2019re whispering in your own ear. MEREDITH: No. JOHN: Mm-hmm. What would stop you from actually doing this, from talking to yourself just like you would talk to a good friend? 112 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE Because you\u2019re talking to yourself\u2014you\u2019re kind of talking to yourself more like somebody who wanted to pull you down. MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And so I just think, oh, what about that good friend? I mean, can you be a good friend to yourself in those moments and say something more supportive? You are a pretty successful in a variety of different things in your life. Right? MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And so if you take one of those examples and you kind of break it down, are you able to\u2014what do you do to prepare? Well, for example, even for a statistics test, I would guess that you have to go through some preparation. MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. Study. JOHN: You study. MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: OK. Kind of like studying\u2014have you ever been in like a play or a dramatic performance of any type? MEREDITH: Oh, no. I avoid that. JOHN:  Totally. Not even like in grade school? MEREDITH: No. I think I maybe was in seventh grade. JOHN: Yeah? MEREDITH: Yeah. But I had a very small part. I\u2019ve always, like, my whole life, shied away from being the center of attention. It never feels good to me. JOHN: No. MEREDITH: Which is ironic, since I\u2019m going to school to become a teacher. JOHN:  Yeah. So you have taught before and spoken in front of groups. 113 Psychotherapy.net MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. JOHN: Small, medium. MEREDITH: Yeah. JOHN: What do you do\u2014 MEREDITH: But it never feels. JOHN: Well, it never feels comfortable, perfectly. MEREDITH: No. Nuh uh. No. Yeah, I\u2014 JOHN: So even right now, as we\u2019re talking. OK? MEREDITH: Uh huh.

JOHN: Yeah, and just before that, you said I always shied away from attention. It\u2019s never felt good. MEREDITH: It\u2019s some pretty black and white thinking. JOHN: Well, that is pretty\u2014yeah, good job noticing that. MEREDITH:  Mm-hmm. JOHN: And I hear you saying that black and white thinking is maybe too general in that it doesn\u2019t provide any real hope for it ever changing. MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. 114 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE JOHN: And in that sense, it does seem like it fits in that unhelpful category. MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. I mean, I definitely think like, you know, if you\u2019re nervous about something, to a certain extent, that\u2019s healthy, because it makes you prepare more. But at the same time, that kind of thinking of being like it will never get better, it will never be OK probably isn\u2019t that helpful. JOHN: Yeah. Yeah.

JOHN: I wonder if there\u2019s some way you could study this way that you have been thinking about yourself. I\u2019m just not clever in a group. I\u2019m just not comfortable. I\u2019ve always shied away from that. I wonder if there would be different ways you could say things to yourself. MEREDITH: Mm-hmm. For instance? JOHN: For instance. MEREDITH: There are times when I am comfortable in groups. JOHN: There are times I am comfortable in groups. And that you probably would put into the more helpful thought category. MEREDITH: Mm-hmm.

I\u2019ll be alone unhappy despite the fact that you told me just a couple minutes ago that you had a very embarrassing experience that now has added to your repertoire as a good storyteller.

JOHN: So you can see that I\u2019m questioning the evidence, and I wonder if you are questioning it too, or if you\u2019re just thinking, I better go along with this for now. MEREDITH: No. I definitely think that you\u2019re right. I just, like, hearing you say that I\u2019m a good storyteller, that\u2019s so not my experience. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a good storyteller, so it\u2019s hard for me just to say, sure. But I agree with the evidence part. JOHN: There is evidence that you have told some good stories.

RITA: Right. Well, you were very gentle and encouraging, and I think that helped her actually reveal even more extreme black and white thinking that she\u2019s subjecting herself to. JOHN: Yeah. In the end, this should help her automatically question her automatic thoughts a little bit more than she did in the past. And I have confidence. In fact, she said at the end of the session, she thought that this would be helpful to her in the future.

I think people get confused. They think, reality. Make people face reality. And, you know, this is an interesting therapy approach that it looks like it has some existential roots. It also has a feel of being very Adlerian in the way it\u2019s used. RITA: That\u2019s true. JOHN: The focus is on concrete behaviors and concrete thoughts that clients have control over. RITA: Right. JOHN: And that\u2019s very important. There\u2019s a big emphasis on self- evaluation. Robert Wubbolding, who\u2019s a leader in the area, says that that\u2019s really kind of the most important piece of reality therapy. He also emphasizes planning and specific planning. And really reality 117 Psychotherapy.net therapy can be captured, I think, in the four big reality therapy questions originally developed by Glasser or but articulate also by Wubbolding. And those are what do you want? What are you doing? Is it working? And should you make a new plan? RITA: So in this set that we\u2019re going to watch, John is working with Sidra, who\u2019s struggling with back pain. And we\u2019ll watch to see how those big four questions actually come into the session. So let\u2019s watch. JOHN: I\u2019m wondering if we had a session today that was positive for you in that you were able to feel that we\u2019ve accomplished something important to you. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: What would that look like? ",

JOHN: What would that look like? SIDRA: There are a thousand things in my mind right now. I don\u2019t know which one I should say. Mmm. JOHN: There are a lot of things that are important to you, and so it\u2019s hard to choose just one. SIDRA: Yeah. Mmm. Maybe let\u2019s start with my back pain, and then maybe we\u2019ll go somewhere. JOHN: Mm-hmm. So one thing then, if we were to have a successful session, it would be important, it would mean something to you, that we might move in a positive direction regarding your back pain. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. OK. Yeah. Like in my brain, I always talk with myself. Though I\u2019m not\u2014it\u2019s not like I\u2019m crazy or something, but it\u2019s like, when you don\u2019t have people around you, you usually talk with yourself. JOHN: Right. SIDRA: So, yeah. I live by myself, and I usually talk, oh, I should do that while I\u2019m doing that. So, like in my brain, I\u2019m talking with myself, so. JOHN: Mm-hmm. I should do that. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And yet it doesn\u2019t happen. And you know, Sidra, it\u2019s my job, 118 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE because I think you\u2019ve identified something that really does mean something to you. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And it\u2019s my job to kind of be a little pushy\u2014 SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: \u2014and to have you focus on really what can you do? How do you\u2014how do you, a very intelligent young woman, figure out a clear schedule to exercise in the ways that are going to make your back better? SIDRA: Mmm. I\u2019m should sleep on time in the night, wake up early morning, and then I can do that. Then I don\u2019t have that, excuse that I\u2019m tired and I want to sleep or something. JOHN: OK. SIDRA: So I think that\u2019s the way I can do and organize the thing. JOHN: So you think it\u2019s better to wake up early in the morning and\u2014 SIDRA: Mm-hmm. Yeah. So. But I\u2019m a night person. That\u2019s the problem. JOHN: Ah. So you like to stay up late and then sleep in. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. And then wake up like, 9:30ish. But if I have to go to work early morning, then 7:30 or 8:30. JOHN: Mm-hmm. ",

JOHN: So as you evaluate yourself, as you can look at your own behavior, you\u2019re pretty clear that you could do better with this. SIDRA: Yeah. Someday. JOHN: Yeah. SIDRA: Yeah. 119 Psychotherapy.net JOHN: And so I\u2019m all about trying to figure out, well, how do you do this better? And so getting to bed earlier, but, you\u2019re a night person. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. Actually I improved a little bit. I was like really a night person\u2014go to bed around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning. But now like 12:00 is like, maximum. JOHN: Yeah. SIDRA: So maybe if I just like, focus on that, I can do better and go to bed like at 10:00 or 11:00, so maybe then I can wake up a good morning actually. JOHN: OK. So what do you think the odds are of you actually achieving that as you talk about it\u2014changing yourself from being a night person to getting to bed at 10 or 11. What are the odds of that working out? SIDRA: Mmm. [QUIETLY] I really hate it. JOHN: I think you may be kind of tricking yourself with that particular solution. SIDRA: Yeah. Like, I want to sleep. It\u2019s like, OK, I should sleep now, because I have to wake up early morning. But something, like maybe my brain or heart or something, is saying, like, no, it\u2019s OK. You can do it. Oh, you have plenty of time, like five, six hours sleep is fine. JOHN: Mm-hmm. SIDRA: So that\u2019s the thing. So it\u2019s like, OK, it\u2019s fine, I can just stay up until maybe 12 or 1:00. JOHN: Or 1:00. SIDRA: And then I can sleep. And then in the week, like, I\u2019m OK, but weekends. Oh. I just like, stay say up until 2:00, talk with friends or family. And so that just changed my schedule again, so. JOHN: Well, yeah. It sounds like one of the hard things is that you really value the time late at night. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And so since you value it that much, it\u2019s hard for you just to say, I\u2019m given that up. It means something to you. ",

JOHN: And so it just doesn\u2019t seem right to say, ah, Sidra, stop that and go to bed at 11:00. And that hasn\u2019t worked very well for you in the past. You\u2019ve tried that quite a lot. And so then I think to myself, well, maybe we should talk about what time during the day\u2014let\u2019s say you stay up until midnight or 1:00, which is normal for you. You enjoy that. SIDRA: Yeah. JOHN: It\u2019s important to you. If you give yourself permission to do that, can you then organize your day to include the exercise that\u2019s going to make a difference? SIDRA: Yes, I can. I mean, that I can come from work and like, done with the day, and then I can do my exercise or yoga. But then again, I was like, tired, time to watch TV, or maybe cooking time. It\u2019s just like, I just don\u2019t want to do that, so I maybe start cooking, though I\u2019m super tired. JOHN: So once a day for 30 minutes or 45 minutes? SIDRA: Mm-hmm. Yeah. JOHN: Which would be better for you? SIDRA: Mmm, I think 45 minutes. JOHN: Yeah. SIDRA: Yeah. JOHN: And so 45 minutes. And then how long does it take you to get ready to\u2014I mean, if you get up at six and you were going to exercise for 45 minutes, would you be able to make it to work by 7:30? SIDRA: Yes. It only takes me like 10, 15 minutes to get ready, so. JOHN: Ah. So, you could get up at 6:30. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And still have time to exercise 45 minutes and get to work at 7:30? Or 6:15? SIDRA: Yeah. It can be possible. 121 Psychotherapy.net JOHN: Mm-hmm. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: So let\u2019s say 6:15. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And then what\u2019s going to get in the way of you getting up at 6:15? SIDRA: Mmm, nothing. At that time, I\u2019ll be like, OK. Now I\u2019m up. I can do that. JOHN: OK. SIDRA: The only thing is like leave my bed, and then, after that, I can do like all stuff. And then I\u2019ll be fine. JOHN: Ah. SIDRA: The only thing is that. JOHN: You are very creative.

And in winter, it\u2019s like 8:30, because of the sun. If I promise myself that I have to wake up early morning to say my prayer on time, then I think I can do that. JOHN: Do you do that? Do you get up in the morning and do your\u2014 SIDRA: I\u2019m not so good at it. JOHN: Not all the time. SIDRA: Not all the time. But especially in Ramadan I can do that, so I always like, wake up for, for my breakfast kind of thing, so at that time, yeah. I can do that. Like in Ramadan, I\u2019m really organized. JOHN: Yeah. SIDRA: So it should be like Ramadan whole year, I think. JOHN: Yeah. 122 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE SIDRA: So. JOHN: Huh. And because that\u2019s very important to you\u2014the Ramadan celebration. SIDRA: Yeah. Mm-hmm. JOHN: And the prorcess. SIDRA: And the fasting and everything, yeah. JOHN: The fasting. OK. Hmm. What is it about that that gets you out of bed to do the morning prayers? SIDRA: I don\u2019t know. I It\u2019s kind of like, passion I would say. Like, oh, I have to do that, because it\u2019s a really important thing, and I want to make God happy, and I have to. It\u2019s kind of like that. So. JOHN: So you develop during that time of year some passion and commitment and desire to make God happy, and so then you get yourself up. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. Yeah. JOHN: Pretty much always? SIDRA: Mm-hmm. Yeah, always. RITA: At the end of this segment, John is very persistent in his confrontations of Sidra. JOHN: Right. And I think it\u2019s important to think about how the confrontations are framed. RITA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: It\u2019s not like I\u2019m harshly confronting her because of something I think she should do. RITA: Right. JOHN: Really the focus from the reality therapy perspective is, what do you want, Sidra? Do you want to have a healthier back?

RITA: Right. In this next section, we get to watch John use his amazing art skills to draw and illustrate the use of the reality therapy car. JOHN: Now Sidra, a couple of things about the kind of counseling or therapy that we\u2019re doing. One is that, as it turns out, there are some things you have control over, and some things you have less control over. Would you say that that seems true? SIDRA: Yeah. JOHN: So I\u2019m going to just draw a little picture here on my clipboard that illustrates what you do have more control over and less control over. SIDRA: OK. JOHN: And so I\u2019m not a very good drawer, and so I want you to, I guess, have patience with my drawing ability. SIDRA: OK. JOHN: But I\u2019m drawing four wheels here. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And then I\u2019m going to put a car on it. So it\u2019s sort of like we\u2019re looking at a car from up in the air. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And there\u2019s the steering wheel of a car, and there\u2019s an engine. OK. And according to this perspective, there are what they call front wheel behaviors and rear wheel behaviors. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And so the front wheel behaviors are your thoughts. SIDRA: OK. JOHN: And your actions. OK. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. 124 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE JOHN: Those are things that you more or less have control over. SIDRA: Yeah. JOHN: So, for example, when you said you lie in bed and you think, oh, maybe I don\u2019t need to get up and exercise. That\u2019s an example of your thoughts, and you\u2019re aware of them, and you know you can change them sometimes, right? SIDRA: Yeah. JOHN: They\u2019re kind of hard and tricky to change, but you can. SIDRA: Yeah. JOHN: And actions\u2014the actual getting up. You got up and you got here. SIDRA: Yeah. JOHN: Right? SIDRA: Yeah. JOHN: I mean, that\u2019s an example. You have some control over that. Again, we\u2019re all human. ",

SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And back here, we have feelings and we have physiology. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And the feelings are like, anger, sadness\u2014emotions. And the physiology\u2014in your case, the physiology is really important, because you have said that your back pain is one thing that is important to you to change. SIDRA: Yeah. JOHN: It\u2019s a rear wheel behavior in that if you direct your actions and your thoughts points toward the goal of a healthy back, right, because that\u2019s important to you now and in the future\u2014 SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: The physiology will follow. 125 Psychotherapy.net SIDRA: Yeah. JOHN: Just like a car, right? I mean, you turn the front wheels. SIDRA: The back wheels follow. JOHN: The back wheels follow. SIDRA: Yeah. JOHN: Exactly. And so what we really want to do in our time together, and what we\u2019ve done a bit of already is to focus on your thoughts, focus on your actions, and to be very specific about the thoughts and the actions that lead you towards a healthy back. SIDRA: OK. JOHN: And then, and this might be one of the most important things of all, is to make a really good plan for how you can control those thoughts and actions to the best of your ability, to lead the physiology, the back pain, in the right direction. SIDRA: Yeah. JOHN: Does that make sense to you? SIDRA: Yeah. It does. JOHN: So when we think about the back pain, what thoughts and actions do you think of as being most important to take you toward that healthy back goal? SIDRA: Just be careful, as I am right now. But I would say my back really needs care, and I should be gentle with that. Like if I\u2019m sitting, I should sit like straight, rather than to be like this or something. Or with a back\u2014I should have like, some support. And also doing yoga. And, eat healthy. JOHN: OK. So be careful in that make sure that your posture is good. SIDRA: Yeah.

Or maybe also, I\u2019m kind of like a person\u2014if I start something, I just really want to finish that thing, like right away. I have no tolerance, I would say\u2014bad thing. So maybe I should start focusing on that. So if I start something, I can do it tomorrow. So just not like be hard on myself when I I want to do that. JOHN: Yeah.

How do we make it so that\u2014and I like the idea of doubling or tripling up the important things to you, prayer, exercise, breakfast. But then I think, are there other things that can make it even more strong of a pull for you to accomplish these things? And you\u2019re saying no, and I\u2019m continuing to sort of think, hmm. SIDRA: Maybe. JOHN: Maybe. I just think, well, what makes it easier to exercise? What makes it more motivating, simpler? And when you exercise, are you doing yoga? SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: Is that right? Do you do a routine, specific exercises? SIDRA: Specific, just for my back. I cannot do like all of those, 127 Psychotherapy.net otherwise it will start hurting me. JOHN: Right. So you have a set of yoga exercises. And you do them in the same order each time? SIDRA: Yeah. JOHN: And are they written down or are they in a book or on a video or\u2014 SIDRA: It was on a video, but now I remember them, how to do that. So I don\u2019t need the video.

When would you put it in the machine? You can I\u2019m a very picky\u2014 SIDRA:  I can do it today. JOHN: You could go home and put it in the machine so that it\u2019s ready to roll. SIDRA: Yeah.

SIDRA: Yeah. Yeah, my memory\u2019s so good. JOHN: How will you get yourself home and say, I want to do that? SIDRA: I have an excuse. I have to go work right after that.  But yeah, when I will be back, then I can do that. JOHN: Yeah. SIDRA: Mm-hmm. JOHN: And how do you get yourself\u2014you will remember, you\u2019ll get home from work, and you will remember. SIDRA: I know I\u2019m going to do that for sure today, because we are 129 Psychotherapy.net talking too much about that thing. I know I am doing that today. JOHN: So in some ways, this will help with the motivation. SIDRA: Yeah. JOHN: Is it maybe we have an arrangement? I mean, we have an agreement that you will do that? SIDRA: Yeah. Mm-hmm. That can be\u2014yeah. RITA: So in this last section that we just saw, John, you got a little detail-oriented. JOHN: Right. I\u2019m trying to follow that reality therapy rule of a specific plan is a better plan. And so that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing, and I\u2019m also trying to engage Sidra in how do you make a better plan for yourself? RITA: Right, which is something I think she probably really needs some help with. And you make an agreement with her. JOHN: Right. At the end of the session\u2014and I think this is a positive thing in terms of moving her to the future. Sometimes reality therapists are willing to make an agreement to serve as a reminder or a support person in the client\u2019s life. RITA: Which I think, in this case, is going to be very effective for Sidra. JOHN: This next session is an example of feminist counseling, or feminist psychotherapy. Rita is the counselor, and you\u2019re working with a woman named Amanda on some life decisions that she\u2019s facing. RITA: Right. Right. Feminist therapy, in a nutshell, almost always includes a critique of power and of oppression in the culture. And, you know, the truth is it\u2019s just as damaging to males as it is for females. JOHN: And consistent with that concept, feminist theory suggests that the root of pathology or psychopathology is not in the individual, but in the culture. RITA: Right. JOHN: And some of the distorted ways in which\u2014and usually a paternalistic culture\u2014might be affecting or oppressing individuals. And so the listening focuses on how is the culture affecting the 130 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE individual who\u2019s in counseling? What ways maybe has the individual internalized some of the cultural forces, and maybe even is oppressing himself or herself? RITA: Yeah. That\u2019s true. ",

Feminist therapists use pretty much every possible technique, but they almost always use self-disclosure, and they use mutual empathy, and they\u2019re striving to create an egalitarian relationship that really will allow the client to become empowered. JOHN: In the upcoming video segment, Amanda is a very bright and articulate and Southern young woman who\u2019s struggling with some choices she has to make within the context of a complex web of relationships. RITA: Yeah. That\u2019s right. So let\u2019s watch a little. AMANDA: They never say that, but it just seems that way. Because like, my parents were married right after high school, and my mom has three kids and my dad has three kids, but they\u2019re divorced now. And so not the same three. RITA: Right. Right. AMANDA: But, and my brother lives right next door to my mom, with his partner, and they just had a baby. And my sister lives at home still, even though she\u2019s in college. But she still lives at home. And my other sister\u2019s in high school. And they all\u2014my grandmother even lives with my mom, so it\u2019s like, multi-generational right there. Like, my grandmother, my mom, my brother, and my sister were all right there. And my parents always ask me, and my grandparents too, like, when are you coming home and when are you going to start your career? And so it kind of seems to me like\u2014I went away for a while, and now it\u2019s like, maybe it\u2019s time to come home and start a career and a family. And so I just feel like I want those things, and part of me wants them right now, but I also, like, really want to pursue this, so. RITA: So one of the strategies you use to figure out what it was they wanted and to communicate to them that they mattered was sort of to take the time to consult with each one, it sounds like. AMANDA: Yeah. Yeah, and that was really, really huge for me, 131 Psychotherapy.net especially my brother, because he just had a baby. And I just felt like I needed to be there for that like, season of his life. And when I talked to him and he, like, really understood. And he said like if he were me then he would go. ",

But I mean, he\u2019s not at all interested in going to another country. RITA: Right. AMANDA: But knowing me and like hearing me talk about it, he can hear that I really should go. But he knows that I, like, really love him and want to be there and love his daughter and like, want to be there for her. And so me hearing him say that and believing that he really means it, that was probably like the most important part. RITA: Piece of all of it. Yeah. So I have to ask you one question that I think I probably know the answer to. But when you did this consultation round, how did to incorporate Amanda? Did you have a consultation time with yourself? AMANDA:  I don\u2019t know. I mean, I guess I kind of did all along. When\u2014I mean, especially like when I talked it through with my mom, and the more I talked about it, the more I realized that I really believed the things that I was saying. And I got like, more excited about, you know, like the things I want to study\u2014like learning about trauma reconciliation in Ugan\u2014in Rwanda. I\u2019m not going to Uganda. And how that is going to like, apply to things I want to learn later, and maybe like continue my studies after the Peace Corps. And I just got like, more and more excited about it. And so that was kind of a confirmation to me that it\u2019s something I really, really do want to do. RITA: How was your mom\u2014were you convincing her, or was she coming along with you on that? What was the relationship conversation like? AMANDA: Yeah. I think I was convincing her. And I remember at the end of it she was like, wow, I\u2019ve never heard you say\u2014I\u2019ve never heard that before. I didn\u2019t know that this was something that you were so interested in. And I\u2019m really proud of you,  which was a big\u2014probably the biggest part of it. Like, I felt like she really heard me, which hasn\u2019t always 132 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE happened or doesn\u2019t always happen in our relationship, even though I had to like, stop her from interrupting me a few times and like, redirect the conversation back to me.

AMANDA: So. RITA: Yeah. AMANDA: I don\u2019t know if that answers the question, but that\u2019s\u2014 RITA: Yeah, kind of. Because I think when we were talking before, you weren\u2019t so sure you would have family support. In fact, I think that was one of the biggest burdens in making the decision. AMANDA: Mm-hmm. RITA: Besides just the sheer\u2014terror may be too strong a word, but definitely a fear about missing out on life\u2019s developmental pieces that were really valuable to you. That was this other piece with the families voices, like, come home, Amanda. It\u2019s time. You\u2019ve had enough fun out there. AMANDA: Yeah. RITA: And then, so when you checked in with them, it wasn\u2019t quite that unanimous. AMANDA: Right. I mean, of course they want me to be near them, and they don\u2019t understand why I would want to leave Georgia ever. But they like, really want me to be happy and successful and fulfilled, and so they want that more than they want me close to them. And so\u2014and I guess I kind of\u2014maybe I like, hopefully knew that. Like I hoped that would be the case. But to hear them say that, each of them say that, was really good. But also I kind of said, you know, if I don\u2019t like it, I can come home. And so knowing that it\u2019s not like a permanent forever commitment, 133 Psychotherapy.net you know, makes it a little bit easier for everyone, myself included. RITA: So you had permission to give it a try from them. And I\u2019m hearing indirectly that you sorted it out by talking to them. But I still want to come back to that question about how do you check in with just Amanda? Is there some way you do that after you\u2019ve had those conversations? AMANDA: I mean, I do like a little bit of journaling, and a lot of praying. And like sometimes I\u2019ll just take a walk, and just like be. RITA: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. AMANDA: So I guess that is checking in with myself. But I don\u2019t\u2014 like, I would probably go crazy if I like, sat down and thought, OK, what do you want to do? ",

It\u2019s more like I feel like I just like start to feel OK about things. And then I know it\u2019s the right or\u2014yeah, the right thing to do. RITA: Yeah. So if you were going to name the most positive role model in your life right now, who would it be? AMANDA: The most positive role model.  That\u2019s like here with\u2014 RITA: It could be anywhere, or a combination of pieces of role modeling that you\u2019ve picked up along the way that you really like how that person is or you would like to be like them. AMANDA: I don\u2019t know.  Maybe like, Nancy,  like my teachers here. I think because\u2014well, like, one thing that I really like about Nancy, um, is that she is like, super, super smart, but she\u2019s a learner. So like, she is really competent in what she knos, but also like, realizes that she doesn\u2019t know everything and is like really interested to hear from people and to like, to learn\u2014and like to add to her own experience. And so that\u2019s something that I really want to be. And sometimes maybe I do that too much. Like, I want people to tell me what I should know  and what I should believe and what I should do. But\u2014 RITA: You like that value of her willingness to let in other opinions 134 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE and learn new things, and also she\u2019s really smart and you like that. AMANDA: Yeah, and really confident about her own ideas and beliefs, which I would like to have more. RITA: Yeah. That\u2019s the piece I was thinking might be the role model piece, like, OK, here\u2019s this really smart woman who isn\u2019t afraid to take in new information. But, she\u2019s also pretty confident about what she does know and who she is. AMANDA: Yeah. RITA: And that\u2019s what I see you moving toward as you sort out the different voices in your life and\u2014 AMANDA: Yeah. RITA: Yeah.

JOHN: Right. And so feminist therapy is focusing on how Amanda can find her voice and find her place in the world. RITA: Yep I have to struggle a little bit with Amanda to bring her back to a place where she can look at how she can find her way without feeling guilty or burdened by other people\u2019s expectations. JOHN: That\u2019s a big challenge. RITA: Yes it is. JOHN: And so let\u2019s see how it goes. RITA: OK. AMANDA: Pretend like I\u2019m not really saying goodbye?  is because I\u2019ll probably\u2014I mean, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see them again. And I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll stay in touch. And I don\u2019t like making a big deal out of it, because it makes a big deal out of me.  And I don\u2019t really like that. 135 Psychotherapy.net RITA: It makes a big deal out of you. AMANDA: No, like, I just\u2014I\u2019m obviously really emotional, and so I don\u2019t like saying goodbye over and over and over again, and like\u2014 RITA: So denial kind of works for you. AMANDA: It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s just hard enough. RITA: Yeah. So you\u2019re trying to find ways to make it not quite so repeatedly difficult and sad. AMANDA: Yeah. I\u2019d rather like take the memories that I have and take the meaning that I have from those memories, and say, see you later, instead of like, sit down with every person and tell them why they\u2019re so important to me and how much I\u2019m going to miss them and list the things I\u2019m going to miss. You know? I\u2019d rather just go than do that. RITA: So can I check on just one little piece of that that I heard?

And then it\u2019s pretty predictable that Nancy would say back to you, oh, Amanda, you were awesome. Thank you for the ways you took the leadership. Thank you for the ways that you were so emotionally available in class, and\u2014 AMANDA: RITA: Right? AMANDA: Mm-hmm. RITA: And I\u2019m guessing that it\u2019d be hard saying those things and taking the time, but it would even be harder to sit there and hear back how much people care about you and your strengths. AMANDA: Yeah. Like just yesterday, I say goodbye to the family that I\u2019ve been nannying for. And I kind of wanted it to be like a, well, it\u2019s 136 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE been\u2014it\u2019s been good.  I\u2019ll see ya. And then like, later I would send a thank you card or send a card like writing out how much they mean to me. But the mom, Andrea, like sat down and just told me like how important it is to have someone who she really trusts to take care of her kids, are like, how big of a deal. And I know that\u2019s a huge deal. And, I wanted to, you know, thank her for like, trusting me with the most important thing in her life. But, I just like, it was really hard to like, sit there. I didn\u2019t want to cry and like, get all involved in the moment. And it was hard to hear her like tell me that, basically, you know, that they love me. And it was just hard to hear that.

And I can\u2019t tell you how many women I know who feel like they should clone themselves into at least four, because these people at their church tell them how much they matter and they need to be over there, and their family needs them, and then they\u2019re really good at their work. AMANDA: Yeah. RITA: And then they\u2019re in a reading group, and the group just wants more time with them. And how do you be a wonderful person who everyone wants more of and not go around feeling guilty all the time? AMANDA: Yeah. I don\u2019t know. I wish I did. Because now that like I\u2019m talking about it and you\u2019re pointing it out, I can see like, it was so hard for me to leave Kenya and come here\u2014so hard. And when I think of why it was so hard, I think of like the high school girls that I spent a 137 Psychotherapy.net lot of time with, and they were like, who are we going to talk to now? What are we going to do without you? I just love you a lot and I\u2019m really grateful for you, but I heard, I\u2019m not going to have any friends. I\u2019m not going to have you anymore. RITA: Right. AMANDA: And then every time I leave like, my family, it\u2019s because I feel like my brother needs me, and my little sisters need me. And I know my mom needs me. And yeah, I guess that\u2019s one of the reasons why it\u2019s so hard. RITA: Yeah. AMANDA: And why I don\u2019t like for people to tell me how much they love me, because it translates to I need you.

But sorting that out is\u2014to me, one of the big jobs of adulthood is\u2014I stumbled into this concept when I was working with people with disabilities, and it was called interdependence. Because I think in our culture we either idolize independence\u2014a rough, rugged individual, nobody needs them, they don\u2019t need anybody\u2014or dependence, which is child-like. And, you know, there\u2019s no model for how to be in the middle and to admit that sometimes you need people and sometimes you need to stand on your own individual two feet or whatever. And I think sometimes the burden of being a lovable, capable person is really hard because you have to be the one that decides where the energy goes and where the helping goes. AMANDA: Mm-hmm. RITA: And then people are mad when you take it away, kind of. So love can even be expressed in a kind of mean way, like, I really love 138 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE you, do not leave me. Come back and take care of me. AMANDA:  Yeah. RITA: So the hard message of someone who loves someone saying that is, oh, I am so sorry. I love you, too. And I believe in you. And I think you can find some new ways to meet your needs, because I\u2019m going to be moving on over here. But I still love you. And I still love that you love me. Does that make sense? AMANDA: Yeah. It totally does. RITA: It felt like that was a little sermon, there, but. AMANDA: No, it totally does. And that I\u2019m realizing that I thought that I was carrying this burden of being so needed, and now I\u2019m like, oh, it\u2019s kind of arrogant to think that I\u2019m so\u2014that people like, need me so badly. RITA: Yeah. I had a little bit that same feeling when I was in India, like, oh, what\u2014you know? But it was also this is freeing thing, like, oh, OK. It\u2019s a little embarrassing, like you said. But it\u2019s also kind of freeing. Like,t hen the job becomes to figure out who you are. Do what you need to do with your life. AMANDA: Mm-hmm.

RITA: Yeah. I had a little bit that same feeling when I was in India, like, oh, what\u2014you know? But it was also this is freeing thing, like, oh, OK. It\u2019s a little embarrassing, like you said. But it\u2019s also kind of freeing. Like,t hen the job becomes to figure out who you are. Do what you need to do with your life. AMANDA: Mm-hmm. RITA: Does that feel like a burden or a happy thing or\u2014 AMANDA: A good thing. RITA: Yeah? AMANDA: Freedom is always a good thing. RITA: Mmm, you don\u2019t sound really convinced. AMANDA:  Well, because I\u2019m thinking that sometimes it\u2019s hard, because then you have to like, really look at yourself and figure out who you are and what you want to be, or who you want to be. RITA: I know. I know. AMANDA: But\u2014but, yeah. It\u2019s a good thing. RITA:  Well, that\u2019s something we can talk about in our next session 139 Psychotherapy.net too, if you want. AMANDA: RITA: It may have to be after Rwanda. AMANDA: Yeah. It will. RITA: Yeah. JOHN: What we just saw is pretty profound. RITA: Yeah. JOHN: The whole sense that love can be a burden is a big deal. And it\u2019s also interesting that it\u2019s that balance of communion versus agency. RITA: It is. It\u2019s a very tough balance to find. And also I think there, at the end, Amanda was facing, in a very endearing sort of way, how hard it is to experience freedom. Freedom we think of as very positive, but it\u2019s a burden in itself that we have to decide who we are, how we\u2019re going to be, how to use our own potential in the world. JOHN: Yeah. Amanda is a very bright young woman, and I think she\u2019s insightful, and she has a lot of the qualities that make her an excellent candidate for feminist therapy. This next session is an example of the solution-focused approach. And the featured therapist or counselor in this case is a colleague of ours, Chi Pham, who is a school counselor in a high school setting. RITA: I think solution-focused is often a very great theory for school counselors to use. It\u2019s because solution-focused therapists believe that people are constructing their own reality. JOHN: Exactly, and one of the points I think that solution-focused counselors make is that, well, since people are constructing their own reality, why don\u2019t we just focus it and move it toward the positive and towards strengths and toward solutions, which, I think, is one of the reasons why solution-focused therapists often come across as sort of persistently, and maybe even relentlessly, positive.

RITA: And she\u2019s struggling with the perennial problem of choosing college. So let\u2019s watch a little. CHI PHAM: So I just want to hear from you first. So after our session, what would\u2014how would we know that we had a good session? TESLA: If I could\u2014I\u2019d like to if not have my decision made, but I\u2019d like to have a clear idea of how I can make my decision. That would be ideal. CHI PHAM: And so what kind of decision are we talking about here. TESLA: I need to decide between two schools for next year, going to college. CHI PHAM: All right. So you mentioned feeling guilty about making a choice to go to Richmond, which is really expensive, and you\u2019re wondering if it\u2019s worth the money. So let\u2019s say on a scale of one to 10, and one being like, no guilt at all. You feel really comfortable. And then 10 being like, gut-wrenching guilt. You just, it\u2019s paralyzing. You can\u2019t imagine doing it. About where would you say on that scale are you at right now? TESLA: So, like a seven and a half. CHI PHAM: Seven and a half. And tell me about that guilt feeling. TESLA: Well, I just feel like I\u2019m closing doors for other people, and I feel like I\u2019m being really super, super selfish. And I know it\u2019s for, like, a better future for me, but I don\u2019t want to like affect anyone else in my decision. And I\u2019m going to, and I don\u2019t like that feeling at all. I hate feeling like I\u2019m causing problems or like there\u2019s even a wake in what my decision is. CHI PHAM: OK. So how could we move that just down a little bit to, let\u2019s say, a six. How could we reduce some of that guilt feeling? TESLA: Well, I\u2019d like to work something out with my parents. ",

TESLA: If I could\u2014well, I\u2019d like to take the weight off their shoulders. 141 Psychotherapy.net And if I could get scholarships or student loans. But then that closes doors possibly in my future. And I\u2019d like to be able to pay for some of college\u2014a lot of it. CHI PHAM: OK. So what are some possibilities? You said you can pay for some of college, you could get some more scholarships. TESLA: Mm-hmm. CHI PHAM: How could you do that? TESLA: Well, I don\u2019t know if I can get scholarships this year, because it\u2019s pretty late in the year. But next year, when I\u2019m a sophomore, I can hopefully apply for work-based scholarships. And I plan on doing that, because I don\u2019t want to be a burden for my parents at all. And I\u2019d like to apply for student loans under my name, and not my parents\u2019. CHI PHAM: OK. TESLA: So I\u2019d like to\u2014and that would make me feel better. CHI PHAM: So you\u2019ve got a couple ideas. You\u2019re going to apply for some more scholarships when you\u2019re there, because there\u2019s usually department scholarships, and you\u2019ll learn about other opportunities while you\u2019re on campus. Because it sounds like you\u2019re not getting very much financial aid this first year. TESLA: Nuh uh. CHI PHAM: And I heard about your sister, who\u2019s going to school in a couple of years, so maybe by then\u2014you know, when you have two kids in college, that increases your needs, so that might qualify you for some more loans and scholarships. TESLA: Yeah. CHI PHAM: OK. So let\u2019s take that even further. How could we get it down to a five or maybe a four? How can we really relieve that guilt feeling so where you feel really good about your decision? TESLA: Well, I\u2019d probably need to get a job and help pay for some of it. CHI PHAM: Mm-hmm. TESLA: And if I could do that, it would be really helpful. But I\u2019m 142 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE worried because my parents don\u2019t want me to get a job, because they\u2019ve always said that schooling is my job and doing well in school is my job.

CHI PHAM: Mm-hmm. TESLA: So if I could get a job and save up a little bit, like even if I could just pay for my books, I would feel so much better, because it\u2019s just that little extra expense taken away. CHI PHAM: OK. And so finding a job\u2014maybe work study or summer work. TESLA: Mm-hmm. CHI PHAM: But then you\u2019re still nervous about the school work, because you\u2019re supposed to be there as a student. TESLA: Mm-hmm. CHI PHAM: And so that\u2019s causing also you a little bit of anxiety. TESLA: Yeah. I\u2019m nervous for the workload in school, because I just don\u2019t know if I can handle it with my learning disability. And I don\u2019t know what options I have there for help. CHI PHAM: OK. And tell me a little bit more about your learning disability. TESLA: Well, in high school it\u2019s been easy, because I\u2019m offered so much accommodations and teachers are really forgiving. But I don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll be the same in school. And I don\u2019t want to get there and not be able to handle the work because it\u2019s above my level of comprehension. And that\u2019s a very real possibility, and if I flunk a class, my parents would not be paying for college anymore at all. CHI PHAM: Mm-hmm. OK. And so you managed to get through high school, or you did a great job of getting through high school with some help. And it sounds like you\u2019re nervous about the workload coming up for college, which is now kind of tied in with feelings of guilt that you\u2014I\u2019m not sure that this is a good choice, because it\u2019s a competitive school, and that\u2019s tied in with some anxiety about your 143 Psychotherapy.net ability to do the work. TESLA: Mm-hmm. CHI PHAM: But what have you done in the past when you\u2019ve had those feelings, because I\u2019m sure those have come up before? TESLA: Yeah.

But then I had to like, kick it double into gear to get back. CHI PHAM: Yeah. Tell me about those times when you felt like you were a really good student. Like, yes. I\u2019m doing it really well. TESLA: Well, it helped that I liked my classes. CHI PHAM: OK. TESLA: Like, this year, for example, AP Gov is the hardest class I have ever taken, but I love it. It\u2019s so interesting. And then I do the work because I want to do it, because I like it. But then when there\u2019s classes that I don\u2019t like, like all of my math class that they\u2019re hard for me because the dyslexia makes it really hard to do the math. And I just don\u2019t find it interesting, so I don\u2019t do well in them. CHI PHAM: Right. So picking classes that you really like and you feel excited about. TESLA: Mm-hmm. CHI PHAM: So and one of the great things about college is that you have lots of choices. TESLA: Yeah. CHI PHAM: Right? And there\u2019s all kinds of opportunities that you have never seen before, right? TESLA: Yeah. CHI PHAM: Anthropology classes and gender studies. TESLA: History of Rock and Roll. CHI PHAM: The History of Rock and Roll. Right. Classes that we don\u2019t offer here in high school. And so that sounds like that might 144 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE alleviate some of your anxieties\u2014finding a place or finding classes that you really, really enjoy. TESLA: Yeah. And then I can do well in them. And I think that would help me like, feel like I was getting my money\u2019s worth if I was proving\u2014like, doing well in these classes, and then therefore proving that this is where I should be. But I don\u2019t even know if I can do that. JOHN: Rita, I found myself really liking Chi\u2019s use of the scaling question, which is a traditional solution-focused assessment technique. But he\u2019s using it not only for assessment, but also for intervention purposes to help her shrink that guilt and anxiety a little bit. RITA: Right. It was good. It was a good intervention.

JOHN: Right, which is what he\u2019s going to do in this next segment, where he draws her even further into concrete positive things that she can apply in her life situation in the future. RITA: So let\u2019s look at that. CHI PHAM: And again, tell me some times where you felt like a good student, So something that you enjoyed. And what about doing the homework part, or where you got excited about doing the homework or doing a project. What were some other times where you had those kind of feelings? TESLA: It helped when I had good teachers who understood where I was coming from and why sometimes things were more difficult for me. And I never\u2014I tried not to like, have anything handed to me, because that\u2019s not fair. Just because I\u2019m dyslexic doesn\u2019t mean I deserve 145 Psychotherapy.net tons of special treatment. CHI PHAM: Mm-hmm. TESLA: But it helps when I had teachers who could help me help myself. CHI PHAM: Yeah. So part of having a good class is also having a good teacher. And again, what a great opportunity in college, because the professors are available with office hours. TESLA: Yeah. CHI PHAM: And you can meet them before signing up for their class. TESLA: Yeah. CHI PHAM: And so it seems like there\u2019s a way to find out who your good teachers are, or that you connect with initially. TESLA: And I know there\u2019s good opportunity to, like, connect with program for people with learning disabilities at Richmond. So I hopefully won\u2019t have to take many math classes. CHI PHAM: OK. So we\u2019ve identified a couple things that you can do that make you feel good as a student.

CHI PHAM: How would we get it down\u2014could we get it down to two or three? 146 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE TESLA: I hope so.  I think if\u2014 CHI PHAM: Of the things that you said in high school that was helpful is that you felt like you got a lot of support and some help. And I\u2019m just guessing here, and you tell me. Is there some worry or some feelings about not being able to find or create a support system? TESLA: Mm-hmm. CHI PHAM: You\u2019re going to be halfway across the country. TESLA: And\u2014 CHI PHAM: On your own. New people who don\u2019t know you. TESLA: And new systems that won\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t know if it will help benefit me. CHI PHAM: Mm-hmm.

I want to have them more open and free- flowing. And if like people are interested in me, that would make me feel better. CHI PHAM: Yeah. Because I hear you saying it a little bit as if it\u2019s not a strength, that it\u2019s kind of a negative to be from Montana. TESLA: Yeah. CHI PHAM: But what if it were a positive, and that part of the reason 149 Psychotherapy.net you were there, at school, was to show people another way of being, another part of the country, to share your experiences. TESLA: Yeah. CHI PHAM: And that that is part of other people\u2019s education, too, which is why colleges want geographic diversity. TESLA: Yeah. CHI PHAM: Is that it brings in interesting ideas and different personalities. And\u2014 TESLA: And it gives me a conversation starter. CHI PHAM: A conversation starter. Yeah. ",

TESLA:  Well, I\u2019d first have to become cocky, and I\u2019m not cocky. So. But if I was, I could make some jokes about how we don\u2019t use outhouses in Montana. And then I could be\u2014I can make people laugh, and I\u2019d like to be able to do that. And I feel like that would help me a lot by attracting friends if I can get them laughing first without making a fool of myself, because that\u2019s when people get annoyed with you, if you\u2019re too boisterous. CHI PHAM: Mm-hmm. And so I hear you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re nervous about meeting people, but you\u2019re outgoing. Right? You said that you like to make people laugh. TESLA: Yeah. CHI PHAM: And you have lots of these different interests. Tell me some more about the things that you like about yourself. TESLA: Oh, that\u2019s hard. CHI PHAM: That are interesting. That kind of make up who you are. TESLA: Well, I\u2019m really, really good about caring about people. I have a lot of love that I can spew at people. I have really intense motherly instincts. And, I mean, I like that about myself, I guess\u2014being able to like, care for people. And I\u2019m a good listener,  I guess. CHI PHAM: Yeah? And tell me about what it looks like when you care 150 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE for the people. TESLA: It\u2019s not a about listening\u2014or about me, it\u2019s about like, what I need to do for the other person, and that\u2019s the most important thing sometimes, is being able to care for other people, even when you\u2019re not feeling so great yourself.

Yeah, that takes some time to establish some trust, and\u2014but what I hear you saying too is that it\u2019s easier for you to take care of other people, and not necessarily take care of yourself or do what feels good for you, because that feels guilty and selfish.

RITA: I really liked when she used the successes that he was aware of. Tesla\u2019s been in an acting situation. She\u2019s done shows and plays. And he was able to point her toward those and have her make the transition to what she was facing the future. JOHN: Right. Right. Exactly. And I think what that does is it really helps her develop a concrete plan. He kind of was able to draw the concrete methods of coping out, like who to ask for help and when to ask for help. RITA: Right. Right. Yeah. It was great. So I really think Tesla\u2019s a great candidate for solution-focused, and I think it does work really well in the school setting. This next session is an example of family counseling using a family systems approach. Our colleague, Dr. Kirsten Murray, is the counselor, and she obviously loved doing counseling with families. And she\u2019s also 151 Psychotherapy.net a published author in this area. JOHN: One thing about family systems work is it\u2019s similar to feminist theory in that it places the origin or the roots of the problem outside of the individual. In this case, generally systems\u2014mostly the family system. And so the focus for the family therapist is on, if we can change some of the interactions of the dynamics in the system, we can then address the symptoms that are manifested in specific individuals in the family. RITA: Right. Right. Which makes total sense. In the upcoming video, Kirsten is able to use a number of strategies, but she uses the family structure and some family sculpting to facilitate some very genuine emotional communication in the family. JOHN: And let\u2019s see how that works. MURRAY: Beth, can you tell me a little bit about what it\u2019s like to watch Brayden and Tanner bicker, or what you see? BETH: Yeah. ",

So we know that it\u2019s part of having a sibling. But it just seems\u2014I guess in my mind, I just would like them to appreciate one another and enjoying being together at least sometimes. MURRAY: Yeah. BETH: And it just seems like they are always looking for something to say negative about each other. MURRAY: OK. So for you, as you talk, I think you just want a little bit of peace. BETH: Right. Right. Just let\u2019s get along for a little bit during the day. MURRAY: OK. All right. BETH: Right. MURRAY: OK. So Brayden\u2014sneaky Brayden. Now, was like, a small example of what you guys do to each other, just now? Yeah? All right. So I wonder\u2014Brayden, what did you hear your mom say? 152 COUNSELING & PSYCHOTHERAPY THEORIES: IN CONTEXT AND PRACTICE TANNER: What? BRAYDEN: We\u2019re looking for something negative to say to each other. RITA: Yeah. Do you agree with her, that you think a lot about negative things to say with Tanner? BRAYDEN: Yeah. Because there\u2019s not very many positives. MURRAY: Aww. You even found a negative thing to say just now. TANNER: I don\u2019t [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. MURRAY: And you have a really big smile when you say it, too, like you\u2019re kind of proud of being so sneaky. OK. Tanner, you\u2019re loaded and ready to go, no?

JAKE: \u2014say the most negative\u2014 TANNER: But it is. JAKE: Well, that\u2019s probably what we need to work on. MURRAY: Yeah. So, Jake, right now, I mean, when you\u2019re watching them say negative things back and forth to each other, what\u2019s it like for you? JAKE: Well, they\u2019re just kind of joking right now, but they do. They are very critical of each other. So they\u2019re always looking for things to point out that the other is doing wrong, which, in some cases, is OK, because I kind of have them monitor each other in certain circumstances to make sure they\u2019re safe and doing the right thing.

When you get annoyed, where do you feel that in your body? That 153 Psychotherapy.net might be kind of a strange question at first. JAKE: Yeah. MURRAY: So like when I get annoying, I can feel tenseness in my shoulders. Like, my shoulders start to feel like they\u2019re connected to my ears, or my stomach tightens up, or I might make more fists with my hands. JAKE: Yeah. Probably the shoulders. MURRAY: Your shoulders, yeah. Tanner, when you get annoyed, where do you feel it in your body? In you head? BRAYDEN: I feel it in my face, because he slaps me. TANNER:  I hi-five your face. BRAYDEN: No, you slap me. TANNER: You can go, hi-five. BRAYDEN: You slap me and then\u2014 TANNER: Like, you move your hand so he goes\u2014 BRAYDEN: Hey. MURRAY: So Brayden, you feel annoyed sometimes too? Yeah? Are you feeling especially annoyed right now, Tanner, because you just lost your pen? TANNER: Yup. MURRAY: Yeah. TANNER: And I want my special pink one, too. MURRAY: Ah. You liked it a lot. TANNER: But at least I got my faces.

JOHN: From what we\u2019ve already seen, Kirsten has used modeling and joining and some family sculpting to elicit lots of different responses from the family.

JOHN: You know, that is amazing\u2014just by moving people, having them move each other around a room and having them talk produces these strong emotional reactions. RITA: Yeah.
